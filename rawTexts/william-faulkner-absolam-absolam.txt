INTRODUCTION 
By Harvey Bieit 

To his contemporaries what was not primarily acceptable 
in Dostoyevsky was his subject matter; his style, though 
agitated, was relatively straightforward, his language nat- 
ural, even homely and down at the heel. With Faulkner it 
IS the other way, with a comphcation. His subject matter is 
more perverse, or more consistently perverse, than Dosto- 
yevsky’s, but It is the new Nobel Prize winner’s sty'le and 
language that pnmanly make the general reader and some 
critics regard him with distrust. The style is obhque, invo- 
luted, circumambient; the language is spectacular, a con- 
glomerate; and both the vision and the words are directed 
(dnven would be more exact) by an honesty that is un- 
compromismg and difficult. 

It is no good to deny or behttle this complexity, this 
failure m Faulkner to be acceptable. It is no good merely to 
say the reader must co-operate. What must be reckoned 
with is Faulkner’s total genius, the ponderous sum of its 
multiple rich parts, tlie whole consort dancing together. 
'What must be reckoned with is Faulkner’s scrupulous, 
brooding sensibility; his inventiveness (baroque, jigsawed, 
melodramatic, continuous); his panoramic vision and his 
microscopic sight; his tenacious searchings and his dramatic 
insights; his story-teller’s instinct for circling in, like one of 
his own bird dogs, on the quarry; his hallucmated langu^e 
(wdth its Elizabethan grandeur and its colloqmal exactness). 
Though these may raise barriers, they make Faulkner one 
■ of the original and powerful writers of our time. “It is the 
beautiful bird that gets caged,” a Chinese proverb has it. 
In Faulkner, when die cage is unlocked, the bird’s flight is 
unique and breathtaking. 

The beautiful is dear. It is precisely the task of the critic

INTRODUCTION 


dealing with Faulkner to show that the difficulties are not 
spurious, and that the dearness, the expense, is justified by 
the experience of beauty. It has always seemed to me that to 
open The Sound and the Fury with the chiaroscuro Beiyy 
section was the very opposite of an arbitrary arrangement. 
Having without wammg to pursue the idiot Benjy down 
his nights and days is alienating, constitutes a blindfolding 
that forces you to move tactilely rather than visually. But 
this immersion prepares, teaches, sharpens, attunes, so that 
when the parts begin to fell into place, when the Compson 
femily’s decline and fall begm to crystallize, you are already 
femihar with the language and texture of tragedy. 

Obviously, this process of initiation does not hold only 
for Faulkner; it holds for Donne and Joyce and El Greco. 
It holds for Beethoven’s 13 1 C Sharp Minor Quartet, which 
sounds when first heard like a bitter, alien and unattractive 
language, but which when learned is the beautiful bird 
released. This initiation and subsequent reward hold par- 
ticularly for Absalom, Absalom!, a narrative, a legend, an 
incantation that at the beginning, and for a good way 
further, seems only to permit grudging passage through 
its intersecting mazes; that yet, at every turn, affords an 
awesome and marvelous view, and at whose end there is 
offered the satisfaction of having wimessed and understood 
and participated in a dark history and a human drama. 


Absalom, Absalom! was first published in 1936. It came 
four years after a rich three-year sequence in which Faulkner 
completed Sartoris, The Sound and the Fury, As I Lay Ltyltig, 
Smctuary, and Li^fo in Ai^ust Together with these five, 
Absalom! constitutes the very heart of that Bal- 
Zacian series that invokes the legaids of a people (6398 



INTRODUCTION 


Vlt 

2400 square miles, “William Faulkner, sole owner and pro- 
prietor”) whose towns and pine hills and swamps darkly 
embrace the crisscrossed histories of the Compsons, Sar- 
torises, Sutpens, Benbows, Snopeses, McCaUums. 

The youthful narrator of Absalom, Absalom!, Quentin 
Compson (already a suicide in the earlier The Sound and the 
Fury), is made by Faulkner to be an embodiment of the 
presentness of the past. This is how Faulkner introduces 
both the immediacy of die past, the presentness of the 
legend, and the mam actor in it: 

It was a summer of wistaria. The twilight was full of it 
and the smell of his fedier’s cigar as they sat on the front 
gallery after supper until it would be time for Quentm to 
start, while m the deep shaggy lawn below the veranda 
the fireflies blew and drifted in soft random — ^the odor, 
the scent, which five months later Mr. Compson s letter 
would carry up from Mississippi and over the long iron 
New England snow and into Qu e ntin’s sitting-room at 
Harvard. It was a day of hstening too — the listening, the 
hearing in 1909 mosdy about that 'vdiich he already knew, 
since he had been bom in and still breathed the same air 
in which the church bells had rung on that Sunday 
mnrning in 1833 and, on Sundays, heard even one of the 
original three bells in the same steeple where descendants 
of the same pigeons strutted and crooned or whed.ed in 
short courses resembling soft fluid paint-smears on the 
soft S limm er sky. That Sunday morning in June with, the 
bells ringing peacefill and peremptory and a little ca- 
cophonous— the denominations in concord though not 
in tun^and the ladies and children, and house N^oes 
to carry the parasols and flywhisks, and even a few men 
(the ladies moving in hoops among the miniature broad- 
cloth of little boys and the pantalettes of little girls.

INTRODUCTION 


in the skirts of the time when ladies chd not walk but 
floated) when the other men sitting with their feet on the 
railing of the Holston House gallery looked up, and there 
the stranger was. 

The stranger (the “demon,” Shreve calls him) is Thomas 
Sutpen. Throi^h Quentin all the ramifications of Sutpen’s 
life (he is dead forty years whai the novel begins), and 
therefore all the ramifications of those other lives caught 
up in Sutpen’s own, are contrapuntally recorded and 
brought into sharp and subtle focus. Sutpen’s “design,” 
“Sutpen’s Hundred” (the wresting of lOO miles of land 
firom the Chickasaws, the wresting of a plantation from the 
wilderness by his own and his wild Negroes’ labor) — this 
is the demonology beneath the dark and tragic tale that 
Faulkner mvokes from out the past and which has mesmer- 
ized the living Quentin. 

Only once in the novd does Sutpen pause in his obsessive 
actions, in his relentless judging of whether a thing is or is 
not “adjunctive to the forwarding of the design” and that 
momentarily, to ask a question (without a question mark) 
of Quentin’s grandfiither (who told it to Quentin’s father, 
who told it to Quentin, who is teUmg it to his Harvard 
roommate, Shreve). It occurs at the beginning of the de- 
nouement, and it is crucial. “You see,” he says, “I had a 
design in mind. Whether it was a good or a bad design is 
beside the point; the question is. Where chd I make the 
mistake in it, what did I do or misdo m it, whom or what 
( Injure by it to the extent which this would indicate.” 

The answer is held by Sutpen’s unacknowledged son, 
Charles Bon; it rests in Sutpai’s refusal to rct»gnize him. 
Bon is in love with Sutpm’s daughter, Judith, and Sutpen’s 
unrelteitir^ silence even in the free of the impending mar- 
' that ^ will never sanction is the decisive turn of the

screw. During the gloomy, fearful retreat of the Southern 
armies mto North Carolina, Bon thinks: ‘‘He will not even 
have to ask me; I will just touch flesh with him and I will 
say It myself; You will not need to worry; she shall never 
see me again.” The answer is m this hunger to be minimally 
recognized. The entire complex edifice of Absalom, Ahsdaml 
spins on this delicate moral axis. 

It is a temble Gothic sequence of events, a Wooding 
tragic fiible that Quentin is remembering and being infil- 
trated by while piedng it together for Shreve. Shreve, the 
Canadian, the outsider, is fascinated; Quentm, the South- 
erner, the insider, is trapped. Thomas Sutp)en was unable to 
say, ‘‘Bon, my som” Was it the “design” that had &lt;fevoared 
Sutpen and prevented him from avowing the very thing 
that would have saved the des%n? Was it something in the 
South itself, in its social, political, moral, economic origins 
that was responsible for Sutpen and for all the subsequent 
tragedy? Quentm can make no Jiu^ment: Sutpen himself 
had possessed courage and innocoice, and the same land 
had nourished men and women who had delicacy of feeling 
and capacity for love and gifts for life. When Shreve asks 
Quentin why he hates the South, Quentin responds, “I dont. 
I dont! I don’t hate it! I don’t hate it!” as if it were confession 
and absolution, or a sudden judgment he is called upon to 
make, and for which he is not ready (and will never be), 
on the theoretical, circumstantial and fectual good and evil 
of his pebple and of himself. 


Of all the, novels of Faulkner, Absalom, Absalom! appears 
to be the most persoial. The story, in spite of a complexity 
sometimes, but never quite, to the point of implausibiKty, 
has a quality of being less made-up, less of a m^e-believe, 
than that of SanctHary ot As I Lay Dying or Light in AMgua

INTRODtrCTION 


or Intruder in the Dust. Absalom, Absalom! seems to be more 
than a tale of the tragic relations between a father and his 
sons, to possess deeper s^nificant^, as though for Faulkner 
it were the objective correlative of a vision of the South. 
You will find in it, Faulkner seems to be saymg, a funda- 
mental summing up. The material has immediacy for him, 
and to it he brings urgency. These two elements — ^the im- 
mediacy of the past and the urgency of the present — ^are 
fused under so intense a pressure that it makes of Absalom, 
Absalom! an extreme work, a kind of fiery laboratory of 
its author’s tnumphs and travails. 

The travails are there. The key is pitched high, so high 
that Faulkner attempts to oflfset it by the Canadian Shreve’s 
wmtery blasts. The story is handed aroimd in space from 
narrator to narrator something as a football is by a skiUfiiily 
deceptive backfield; and it is handed around m time, so that 
the focus shifts without warning firom the son’s time to the 
Other’s time to the grandfether’s time. The technique em- 
ployed in relating the narrative is that of a system of screens 
and obstacles, “of deliberately withheld meaning,” as Con- 
rad Aiken wrote, “of progressive and partial and delayed 
disclosure.” And the endless, unsyntactical, neferious sen- 
tences are here to challenge and plague and puzzle and dazzle. 

But these travails are transformed into triumphs. The sus- 
tained, high key, it turns out, is justified by the events, and 
casts, as well, a luminous, lyric unity over tiie colossal pano- 
rama. The story gains as each narrator contributes his special 
fact and sense to what was a painfully secret history; and 
as each observation falls into place the mass begins to coa- 
lesce and the structure to rear toward dramatic complete- 
ness. ^t is to my mind the most structurally perfect of 
JEhulkner’s novels, as well as one of te greatest.) The system 
obsta^ts is pitesely the means hy which' one ultirna^y 
^ tnah; it is;also the way in which one tells a bcay

not only in order to impart its chronology of discovery, 
but to give accent to the v/ay m which the story was 
dredged up, fragment by fragment, out of the remote past. 
The unsyntactical sentences retard and surround and engage 
the reader so that he not only remembers more and expen- 
ences more but becomes susceptible to the pulsating, strong 
rhythms of Faulkner’s world. 

The temptation in writing about Faulkner is to quot^ 
is to take any category that comes to mind, weather, for 
instance, or love, or adolescence, or horses, and demonstrate 
this phenomenon of esthetic encirclement. To succumb to 
the temptation but once, here is Faulkner descnbmg Oxford 
on the eve of war: 

And there would be music at night — ^fiddle and tri- 
angle among the blazing candles, the bloAving of curtains 
in tall windows on the April darkness, the swing of 
cnnoline indiscriminate within the circle of plain gray 
cuflf of the soldier or the banded gold of rank, of an 
army even if not a war of gentlemen, where private and. 
colonel called each other by their given names not as one 
fermer to another across a halted plow in a field or 
across a counter m a store laden widi calico and cheese 
and strap oil, but as one man to another above the two 
raised glasses of scuppemong claret or bought champagne 
— ^music, the nightly repetitive last waltz as the days 
passed and the company waited to move, the brave trivial 
glitter against a black night not catastrophic but merely 
background, the perennial last scented spring of youth ** 

Toward the end of Absalom, Absalom! I found myself 
especially captured by a passage in which Quentin and 
Shreve identify themselves with the feteful, firatricidal ride 
of Charles Bon and Henry Sutpen, taken nearly a half

century before. “So that now/’ Faulkner writes, “it was 
not two but four of them riding the two horses through 
the dark over the frozen December ruts that Christmas 
Eve. . No, I thought, it is not four. It is five who take 
that ride. It is the sum of all the readers throughout the 
entire world.

Prom a little after two odock tmtil almost sundown 
of the long still hot weary dead September afternoon diey 
sat in what Miss Coldfield still called die office because her 
father had called it that— a dim hot airless room with the 
blinds aU closed and fiistened for forty-three sammm be- 
cause when she was a girl someone had believed that light 
and moving air carried heat and that dark was always cooler, 
and which (as the sun shone fuller and fuller on that side of 
the house) became latticed with yellow slashes full of dust 
motes which Quentin thought of as bang flecks of the dead 
old dried paint itself blown inward firom the scaling blinds 
as wind tnight have Mown fliem. There was a wistaria vine 
blooming for the seccaid time that summer on a wooden 
trellis before caie window, into which i^artows came now 
and thm in random gusts, making a dry vivid dusty sound 
before going away: and opposite Quentin, Miss Coldfield 
in the eternal black which she had worn for forty-three years 
now, whether for sister, fotho:, or nolhusband none ^ew, 
sitting so bolt upri^ in the straght bard chair diat was so 
tall for her that her kgs hung straight and rgid as if she had 
iron shinbones and ankles, dear of the floor with tha t air ofim- 
potent and static rage like childrai*s foet, at^ tal k in g in that 
grim h gga rd amazed voice until at last listening would re- 
nege and heariig-saise sdlf^onfound and the long-dead ob- 
ject of her impotent ytt indomitable fiiistration wotdd ap-

pear, as though by outraged recapitulatioii evoked, quiet 
inatteutive and harmless, out of the biding and dreamy and 
■victorious dust. 

Her voice virould not cease, it would just vanish. There 
■would be die dim coASn-smelling gloom sweet and over- 
swKt "with the twice-bloomed ■wistaria against the outer 
wall by the savage quiet September sun impacted distilled 
and hyperdistilled, into whidi came now and then the loud 
cloudy flutter of the sparrows like a flat limber stick whipped 
by an idle boy, and Ae rank smell of female old flesh long 
embatded in virginity while the wan haggard face watched 
him above the i^t triangle of lace at 'wrists and throat &amp;om 
the too tall chair in which she resembled a cxucifled child; 
and the voice not ceasing but vanishing into and then out of 
the long intervals like a stream, a trickle running horn patch 
to patch of dried sand, and the ghost mused with shado'wy 
dodlity as if it were the voice which he haunted where a 
more fortunate one would have had a house. Out of quiet 
thunderclap he would abrupt (man-horse-demon) upon a 
s%ne peaceful and decorous as a schoolprize water color, 
fomt sulphur-reek still in hair clothes and b^d, with grouped 
behind him his band of ■wild niggers like beasts half tamed to 
■walk upright like men, in attitudes 'wild and repo^d, and 
manacled anumg thmi the french architect with his air 
grim, haggard, and tatter-ran. Immobile, bearded and hand 
palm-lifted the horseman sat; bdbind him the 'wild blacks 
and the captive architect huddled quiedy , carrying in blood- 
less paradox the shovels and picks and axes of peaceftd cm- 
q[uest. Then in the long nnamaze Quentin seemed to watch 
them ovetzun stuldenly the hundred square utiles of tranquil 
and astonished earth and drag house and formal gardens ttio- 
jendy out o£the sounclless Nothing and clap thein down like 
«atds a tabk.beneath die up-palm Icnmobfle and pcm- 



tific, creating the Sutpen’s Hundred, the Be Sutpetiks Hmdred 
like the oldentime Be Light. Then hearii^ would ra:ondle 
and he would seem to listen to two separate Quentins now — 
the Quentin Compson preparing for Harvard in the South, 
the deep South dead since 1865 and peopled with garrulous 
outraged baffled ghosts, listening, having to listen, to one of 
the ghosts which had refused to lie sffll even longer than 
most had, tdhng him about old ghost-times; and the Quen- 
tin Compson who was still too young to deserve yet to be a 
ghost, but nevertheless having to be one for all that, since he 
was bom and bred in the deep South the same as she was — 
the two separate Quentins now talking to one another in the 
long silcace of notjieople, in nodanguage, like this: seems 
tha this demon — his name was Sutpen — (Colonel Sutpen ) — 
Colonel Sutpen. Who came out of nowhere and without warning 
upon the land wiA a hand of strange niggers and built a plantation 
— (Tore violently a plantation. Miss Rosa Coldfield says) — tore 
violently. And married her sister Ellen and begot a and a daugh- 
ter which — (Without gentlmess begot, Mss Rosa Coldfield says) 
— without gentleness. Whidt should have been the Jewek of his 
pride and the shield and comfort of his old age, only — (Only they 
destroyed him or somethir^ or he destroyed them or something. 
And dkd)^-and died. Widvmt regret. Miss Rosa Coldfield says — 
(Save by her) Yes, save by her. (And by Quentin Compson) Yes. 
And by Quentin Compson. 

“Because you are going away to attend t^ coD^ at 
Harvard they tell me,” Miss Coldfield said. “So I dont int- 
agine you will ever come back here and setde down as a 
country lawyer in a litde town like JeBfeKon, since Northern 
people have already sKa to it that there is little left in die 
^uthfbr a young man. So maybe you will enter die literary 
prt^fts^on as so many Southern gendemea and gendewomen 
too are doing now and maybe some day you will remember 

9 



this and write about it. You will be married then I expect 
and perhaps your wife will want a new gown or a new chair 
for the house and you can write diis and submit it to the 
m^azines. Perhaps you will even remember kindly then the 
old woman who made you spend a whole afternoon sitting 
indoors and listening while she talked about people and 
events you were fortunate enough to escape yourself when 
you wanted to be out among young friends of your own 

“Yessum,” Quentin said. Only she dont mean that, he 
drought. It's because she wants it told. It was still early then. 
He had yet in his pocket the note which he had received by 
the hand of a small negro boy just before noon, asking him 
to call and see her — ^the quaint, stiffly formal request which 
was actually a s ummo ns, out of another world almost — the 
queer archric sheet of ancient good notepaper written over 
with the neat faded cramped script which, due to his aston- 
ishment at the request from a woman three rimes his age 
and whom he had known all his life without having ex- 
changed a hundred words with her or perhaps to the £act 
that he was only twenty years old, he did not recognize as 
revealing a character cold, implacable, and even ruthless. He 
obeyed it immediately after the noon meal, walking the half 
mile between his home and hers through die dry dusty heat 
of early September and so into the house. It too was some- 
how smaller than its actual aze — it was of two storys — un- 
painted and a litde shabby, yet with an air, a quality of grim 
endurance as though like her it had been created to fit into 
and complement a world in all ways a litde smaller than the 
one in which it found itseE There in the gloom of the shut- 
toed hallway whose air was even hotter than outside, as if 
thoe were prisoned in it like in a tomb aU the suspiration of 
slow heat4aden time whidi had recurred during the forty- 

10 



five years, lie anall figure in black -vdach did not evea 
rosde, die wan triangle of lace at wrists and diroat, the dim 
fece looking at him with an expression speculative, argent 
and intent, waited to invite him in. 

Jit s because she wants it told, he thought, so that people whom 
she will never see and whose names she will never har and who 
have never heard her name nor seen her face will read it and know 
at last why God let us lose the Wan that only through die blood 
of our men and the tears of our women could He stay this demon 
and efface his name and lineage from the earth. Then almnst: im- 
mediately he decided that neidier was this the reason why 
she had sent the note, and sending it^ why to him, since i£ 
she had merely wanted it told, written and even printed, she 
would not have needed to call in anybody — z woman who 
even in his (Quentin’s) fathar’s youth had already estab- 
lished herself as the town’s and the county’s poetess laureate 
by issuing to the stem and me^er subscripdon Kst of the 
county newspaper poems, ode, eulogy and epitaph, out of 
some bitter and implacable reserve of undefiat. 

It would be three hours yet before he would learn why die 
had sent for him because part of it, the first part of it, Quai- 
tin aheady knew. It was a part of his twenty years’ heritage 
o£ breathing the same air and hearing his fither talk about 
the man Sutpen; a part of the town’s— Jefferson’s — eighty 
years’ heritage of die same air which the man himself had 
breathed betwem this September afternoon in 1909 and that 
Sunday morning in June in 1833 when he first rode into town 
out of no discernible past and acquired his land no one knew 
how and built his house, his mansion, apparendy out of 
nothing and married Elkn Coldfield and begot his two chU- 
dren — ^the son who widowed the daughter who had not yet 
been a bride — ^and so accomplished his allotted course to its 
violent (Miss Coldfield at least would have said, just) cod.

Qoeatin had grown up with that; the mere names were m* 
teKhangeable and almost myriad. Hh childhood was full of 
than; his very body was an empty hall echoing with sonor- 
ous ddEeated names; he was not a being, an entity, he was a 
commonwealth. He was a barrack filled with stubborn 
back-looking ghosts still recovering, even forty-three yeais 
afierward, firom the fever which had cured the disease, wak- 
ing from the fever without even knowing that it had been 
the fever itself which they had fought against and not the 
sickness, looking with stubborn recalcitrance backward be- 
yond the fever and into the disease with actual regret, weak 
from the fever yet free of the disease and not even aware 
that the freedom was that of impotence, 

(“But why tell me about it?” he said to his fether that 
evraiitg, whm he returned home, after she had dismissal 
him at last with his promise to return for her in the bt^y; 
“why tell me about it? What is it to me that the land of the 
earth or whatever it was got tired of him at last and turned 
and destroyed him? What if it did destroy her family too? 
It's going to turn and destroy us all some day, whether our 
name happens to be Sutpen or Coldfield or not.” 

“Ah,” Mr Compson said. “Years ago we in the Soah 
made our women into ladies. Ihen the War came and made 
the ladies mto ghoste. So what else can we do, bemg geode- 
men, but listen to them being ghosts?” Then he sai^ “Do 
you want to know the real reason why she chose you?” 
They were sitting on the gallery after aipper, waiting for 
the time Miss Coldfield had set for Quentin to call for her, 
“It's because she will need someone to go with her— a man, 
a gendeman, yet one still young enot^ to do whuU: die 
wants, do it the way die wants it done. And die chose you 
iKcaii^ your grandfatha was the nearest thing to a £ci^ 
Sutpen ever h^ in this county, and she probaidy believes 



that Sutpen may Lave told your grandfather something 
about himself and her, about that engagement which did not 
engage, that troth which failed to plight. Might even have 
told your grandfather the reason why at die last she refused 
to marry him. And that your grandfather might have toH 
me and I might have told you. And so, in a sense, the afiair, 
no matter what happens out there tonight, will still be in 
the family; the skdeton (if it be a skeleton) still in the doset. 
She may believe that if it hadn’t beoi for your grandfather’ s 
fiiendship, Sutpen could never have got a foothold here, 
and that if he had not got that foothold, he could not Lave 
married Ellen. So niaybe she considers you pardy respon- 
sible throt^h heredity for what happened to her and her 
family through him.”) 

Whatever her reason fijr choosing him, whether it was 
that or not, the getting to it, Quentin thought, was taking a 
long time. Meanwhile, as though in inverse ratio to the van- 
ishing voice, the invoked ghost of the man whom she conld 
neither forgive nor revenge hersdf upon began to assume a 
quality almost of solidity, permanence. Itself ciratmamHeat 
and enclosed by its effluvium of hell, its aura of unr^enera- 
tion, it mused (mused, thought, seemed to pos^ss sentience, 
as if, though dispossessed of the prace — who was impervious 
anyhow to fotigue— which she declined to g^ve it, it was 
stffl irrevocably outside the scope of her hurt or harm) with 
that: quality peaceful and now harmless and not even very 
attentive — ^the ogre«hape which, as Miss Coldfidd’s voice 
went on, resolved out of itself before Quentin’s eyes the two 
half-ogre children, the three of them forming a shadowy 
background for die fourth one. Ihis was the mother, tie 
dead sister EHen: this Niobe without tears who had con- 
cdved to the demon in a kind of nightmare, who even while 
alve had moved but without Bfo and grieved but without 

13 



weeping, who now had an air of tranquil and unwitting 
desolation, not as if she had dtha: outlived the others or had 
died first, but as if she had never lived at alL Quentin seemed 
to see them, the four of them arranged into the conventional 
fenuly group of the period, with formal and h&amp;less decorum, 
and seen now as the fading and ancient photograph itself 
would have been seen enlarged and hung on the wall behind 
and above the voice and of whose presence there the voice’s 
owner was not even aware, as if she (Miss Coldfield) had 
never seen this room before — a. picture, a group which even 
to Quentin had a quality strange, contradiaory and bizarre; 
not quite coniprehensible, not (evai to twenty) quite right 
— a group the last member of which had been dead twenty- 
five years and the first, fifty, evoked now out of the airless 
gloom of a dead house between an old woman’s grim and 
implacable unforgiving and the passive chafing of a youth 
of twenty telling himself even amid the voice Maybe you 
have to know anybody awjitl well to love them but when you have 
hated somebody for forty-three years you will know them awjul 
well so maybe it’s better then, maybe it’s fine then because after 
fniy-tkree years they coni any longer surprise you or mdhe you 
ddier vary contented or very mad. Aad maybe it (the voice, the 
talking, the incredulous and unbearable amazement) had 
even been a cry aloud once, Quentin thou^t, long ago 
vthen ^e was a girl — of young and indomitable unregret, of 
indictment of blind circumstance and savage evmt; but not 
now: now only the londy thwarted old female fledi emr 
btitded for forty-three years in the old insult, the old unfor- 
giving outraged and betrayed by the final and complete 
aflSront which was Sutpen’s death: 

“He wasn’t a gendtanan. He wasn’t even a gaidemam. He 
came hef e with a horse and two pistols and a name which 
nobody ever heard before, knew fin: ccataia was his own 



any more than, the horse was his own or evai the pistols, 
seeking some place to hide himself, and Yoknapatawpha. 
County supplied him with it. He sought the guarantee of 
reputable men to barricade him from the other and later 
strangers who might come seeking him in turn, and Jefferson 
gave him that. Then he needed respectability, the shield of a 
virtuous woman, to make his position impregnable even 
against the men who had given him protection on that in- 
evitable day and hour when even they must rise gainst him 
in scorn and horror and outrage; and it was min e and Ellen’s 
frither who gave him that. Oh, I hold no brief for Ellen: 
blind romantic fool who had only youth and inexperience 
to excuse her even if that; blind romantic fool, then later 
blind woman mother fool whea she no longer had either 
youth or inexperience to excuse her, when she lay dying in 
that house for which she had exdianged pride and peace both 
and nobody there but the daughter who was sJready the 
same as a widow without ever having b^n a bride and was, 
three years later, to be a widow sure enough without having 
been anything at all, and the son who had repudiated the 
very roof under which he had been bom and to which he 
would return but once more before disappearing for good, 
and that as a murderer and almost a fratricide; and he, fiend 
blackguard and devil, m Virginia fighting, where the chances 
of the earth’s being rid of him were the best anywhere imder 
the sun, yet EUm and I both knowing that he would return, 
that every man in our armies would have to foil before 
bullet or ball found him; and only I, a child, a child, mind 
you, four years younger than the very niece I was asked to 
save, for EUen to turn to and say, ‘Protect her. Protect Judith 
at least.’ Yes, blind romantic fool, who did not even have 
th at hundred miles of plantation which, apparently moved 
our father nor that big house and the notion of slaves under- 

15 



jSx&gt;t day and night which reconciled, I wont say moved, her 
aunt. No: just the Btce of a man who contrived somehow to 
swagger even on a horse — a. man who so far as anyone (in- 
cluding the father who was to give him, a dar^hter in mar- 
riage) knew dther had no past at all or did not dare reveal it 
— a man who rode into town out of nowhere with a horse 
and two pistols and a herd of wild beasts that he had hunted 
down singlehanded because he was stronger in fear than even 
they were in whatever heathm place he had fled feom, and 
that French architect who looked like he had bem hunted 
down and caught in turn by the negroes — a man who fled 
here and hid, concealed himself behind respectability, behind 
(hat hundred miles of land which he took from a tribe of 
ignorant Indians, nobody knows how, and a house the size of 
a courthouse where he lived for three years without a win- 
dow or door or bedstead in it and still c^ed it Sutpen’s Hun- 
dred as if it had been a king’s grant in unbroken perpetuity 
£:om his great grandfather — ^a home, position: a wife and 
femily which, being necessary to concealment, he accepted 
along with the rest of respectability as he would have ac- 
cepted the necessary discomfert and even pain of the briers 
and thorns in a thicket if the thidret could have ^ven him 
the protection he sought 

“No: not even a gentleman. Marrying Ellen or marrying 
ten thousand Ellens could not have made him one. Not that 
he wanted to be one, or even be taken for one. No. That was 
not necessary, since all he would need would be Ellen’s and 
our fethar’ s names on a wedding license (or on any other pat- 
ent of respectability) (hat people could look at and readjust 
as he would have wanted our fether’s (or any othar reputable 
ipan’s) signature on a note of hand because our father knew 
who lus fether was in Tmnessee and who his grandfether had 
been in Vu^nia and our nei^hors and the p^le we lived 



among knew that we knew and we knew they knew we 
knew and we knew that they would have believed us about 
whom and where he came i&amp;om even if we had lied, just as 
anyone could have looked at hitri once and known that he 
wotild be lying about who and where and why he came from 
by the vay fret that apparaitly he had to refuse to say at all. 
And the very fact that he had had to choose respectability to 
hide behind was proof enough (if anyone needed further 
proof) that what he fled from must have been some opposite 
of respectability too dark to talk about. Because he was too 
young. He was just twenty-five and a man of twenty-five 
does not voluntarily undertake the hardship and privation of 
dearir^ virgin laud and establishing a plantation in a new 
country just for money; not a young man without any past 
that he apparently cared to discuss, in Mississippi in 1833, 
with a river full of steamboats loaded with drunken fi)ols 
covered with diamonds and bent on throwing away their 
cotton and slaves before the boat reached New Orleans — ^not 
with all this just one night’s hard ride away and the only 
handicap or obstacle being the other blackguards or the risk 
of being put ashore on a sandbar, and at die remotest, a hemp 
rope. And he was no younger son sent out from some old 
(juiet country like Virginia or Carohna with the surplus ne- 
groes to take up new land, because anyone could look at those 
negroes of his and tell that they may have come (and prob- 
ably did) from a muidi older country than Virginia or Caro- 
lina but it wasn’t a quiet one. And anyone could have looked 
ona; at his face and known that he would have chosen the 
river and even the certainty of the hemp rope, to undertaking 
what he undertook evai if he had known that he would find 
gold buried and waiting for him in the very land which he 
had bought. 

. **No. I hold no more brief for Ellen than I do for myseK 

17 



I hoM even less for myself, because I had had twenty years in 
which to watch him, where Ellen had had but five. And not 
even those five to see him but only to hear at second hand 
what he was doing, and not even to hear more than half of 
that, since apparently half of what he actually did during those 
five years nobody at all knew about, and half of the remain- 
der no ma n would have repeated to a wife, let alone a young 
girl; he came here and set up a raree show which lasted five 
years and Jefierson paid him for the entertainment by at least 
shielding him to the extent of not telling their womenfolks 
what he was doing. But I had had all my life to watph him 
in, since apparently and for what reason Heaven has not seen 
fit to divulge, my life was destined to end on an afternoon in 
April fbrty-lhree years ago, since anyone who even had as 
htde to call Hving as I had had up to that time would not call 
what I have had since hvmg. I saw what had happened to 
Ellen, my sister. I saw her almost a reduse, watching those 
two doomed children growing up whom she was helpless to 
save. I saw the price which she had paid for that house and 
that pride; I saw the notes of hand on pride and contentment 
and peace and all to which she had put her signature when 
die walked into the church that night, begin to fall due in 
succession. I saw Judith’s marriage forbidden without rhyme 
or reason or shadow of eimuse; I saw Ellai die with only me, 
a child, to turn to and ask to prot«:t her remaining child; I 
saw Henry repudiate his home and birthright and then rec- 
tum and practically fling the bloody corpse of his aster’s 
sweetheart at the hem of her wedding gown; I saw that man 
return — the evil’s source and head which had outlasted all its 
victims— who had created two diildrai not only to destroy 
one another and his own line, but my line as well, yet 1 
agreed to marry him. 

“No. I hold no brief for mysdfi I don’t plead youth, since

wh&amp;t creature in, die South since i86i, mati woman nigger 
or mule, tad tad time or opportunity not only to tave been 
young, but to have heard what being young was like £bom 
those who had. I don’t plead propinquity: Ae fact rbat I, a 
woman young and at the age for mar rying and in a rimft 
when most of the young men whom I would have known 
ordinarily were dead on lost battlefields, that I lived for two 
years under the same roof with him. I dont plead material 
necessity: the feet that, an orphan a woman and a pauper, I 
turned naturally not for protection but for actual food to my 
only kin: my dead sister’s family: though I defy anyone to 
blame me, an orphan of twenty, a young woman without 
resources, who should desire not only to justify her situation 
but to vindicate the honor of a family the good name of 
whose women has never been impugned, by accepting the 
honorable profier of marriage from the man whose food she 
was forced to subsist on. And most of all, I do not plead my- 
self: a young woman emerging firom a holocaust which had 
taken parents security and ^ from her, who had seen all diat 
living meant to her fell into ruins about the feet of a few 
figures with the shapes of men but with the names and stat- 
ures of heroes — a. young woman, I say, t^own into daily and 
hourly contact with one of these men who, despite wlat he 
might have been at one tinse and despite what she might have 
bdieved or even known about him, had fought &amp;r four hon- 
orable years for the soil and traditions of the land where she 
had hem bom. And the man who had done that, villain dyed 
though he be, would have possessed in her eyes, even if only 
firom association with them, the stature and shape of a hero 
too, and now he also emerging firom the same holocamt in 
which she had suffered, with nothing to fern what the futur?! 
held for the South but his bare hands and the sword which he 
at l^t had never surrendered and the citation fi&gt;r valor firom 


19 



ius defeated Cotnmandcr-m-Cbie£ Oh, he was brave. I have 
never gainsaid that But that our cause, our very life and 
future hopes and past pride, should have been thrown into 
the balance with men like that to buttress it — ^men with valor 
and strength but without pity or honor. Is it any wonda: 
that Heaven saw fit to let us lose?” 

“No’me,” Quentin said. 

“But that it should have been our father, mine and Ellen’s 
father of all of them that he knew, out of all the ones who 
used to go out there and drink and gamble widi him and 
watch him fight those wild negroes, whose daughters he 
might even have won at cards. That it should have been our 
father. How he couldhaveapproached papa, on what grounds; 
what diere could have been besides the common civihty of 
two men meeting on the street, between a man who came 
firom nowhere or dared not tdl where and our father; what 
there could have been between a naan like that and papa — a 
Methodist steward, a merchant who was not rich and who 
not only could have done nothing umler the son to advance 
his fortunes or prrapects but could by no stretch df the im- 
agination even have owned anything that he‘ would have 
wanted, even picked up in the roadr— a man who owned 
ndther land nor slaves except two house servants whom he 
had fieed as soon as he got them, bought them, who neither 
drank nor hunted nor gambled— -what there could have been 
between a man who to my certain knowledge was never in 
a Jefiferson church but three times in his life — ^the once when 
he first saw Ellen, the once whm they rdiearsed the wedding, 
die ontte when they performed it — a nwn that anyone could 
look at and see that, even if he apparendy had none now, he 
was accustomed to having money and intended to have it 
agam and would have no scruples about how he got it— that 



man to discover Ellen inside a church. In diurch, mind you, 
as though there were a fatality and curse on our family and 
God Himself were seeing to it that it was performed and dis- 
diarged to the last drop and dreg. Yes, fatality and curse on 
the South and on our family as though because some ancestor 
of ours had elected to establish his descent in a land primed 
for fatality and already ansed witih it, even if it had not ra- 
ther been our family, our father’s progenitors, who had in- 
curred the cune long years before and had been coerced by 
Heaven into establishing itself in the land and the time already 
cursed. So that even I, a child still too young to know more 
than that, though Ellen was my own sister and Henry and 
Judith my own nephew and niece, I was not even to go out 
there save when papa or my aunt was with me and that I was 
not to play with Henry and Judith at all except in the house 
(and not because I was four years younger than Judith and 
six years younger dian Henry: wasn’t it to me that Ellrai 
turned before she died and said ‘Protect them’?) — even I used 
to wonder what our father or his father could have done h6- 
fore he married our mother that Ellen and I would have to 
expiate and neither of us alone be sufficient; what crime com- 
mitted that would leave our family cursed to be instruments 
not only for that man’s destruction, but for our own.” 

“Yessum,” Quentin said. 

“Yes,” the grku quiet voice said from beyond the unmov- 
ing triangle of dim lace; and now, among the mumig and 
decorous wraiths Quentin seemed to watch resolving the fig- 
ure of a little girl, in the prim skirts and pantalettes, the smooth 
prim decorous braids, of the dead time. She seemed to stand, 
to lurk, behind the neat picket fence of a small, grimly mid- 
dledass yard or lawn, looking out upon the whatever ogre- 
world of that quiet village street with that air of children 
bom too late into their parents’ lives and doomed to cx&gt;n- 

21 



template all human behavior through the complex and need- 
less follies of adults — an air Cassandrahke and humorless and 
profoundly and sternly prophetic out of all proportion to the 
actual years evea of a duld who had never been young. “Be- 
cause I was bom too late. I was bom twenty-two years too 
late — a child to whom out of the overheard talk of adults my 
own sister’s and my sister’s children’s f^es had come to be 
like the faces in an ogre-tale between stqjper and bed long 
before I was old enough or big enough to be permitted to 
play with them, yet to whom that sister must have to turn 
at ^ last when she lay dying, with one of die children van- 
ished and doomed to be a murderer and the other doomed 
to be a widow before she had even been a bride, and say, 
‘Protect her, at least. At least save Judith.’ A child, yet whose 
child’s vouchsafed instinct could make that reply which the 
mature wisdom of her elders apparendy could not make: 
‘Protect here From whom and from whate He has already 
given them life: he does not need to harm them further. It 
is from themselves that they need protection.’” 

It should have bem later than it was; it should have bem 
late, yet the yellow slashes of mote-palpitant sunlight were 
latticed no higlter up the impalpable wall of gloom whidi 
separated them; the sun seemed hardly to have moved. It ' 
(foe talking, foe telling) seemed (to him, to Quentin) to par- 
take of that logic- and reason-flouting quality of a dream 
which foe sleeper knows must have occurred, stiUbom and 
complete, in a second, yet foe very quality upon which it 
must depend to move foe drKtmer (verisimilitude) to cre- 
duKtjr— horror or pleasure or amazement— depends as com- 
pletely upon afommi recognition of and acceptance of dapsed 
and yet-elapsing time as mutic or a printed tale. “Yes. I 
was bom too kte. I was a child who was to remember those 
three foces (and his, too) as seen for foe first time in foe car- 



mge on that first Sunday morning when this town finally 
realized that he had turned that road from Sutpen’s Hundred 
in to the church into a race trade. I was three then, and 
doubtless I had seen them before; I must have. But I do not 
remember it. I do not even remember ever having seen Ellen 
before that Sunday. It was as though the sister whom I had 
never laid eyes on, who before I was bom had vanished into 
the stroi^old of an ogre or a djinn, was now to return 
through a dispaisation of one day only, to the world which 
she had quitted, and I a diild of three, waked early for the 
occasion, dressed and curled as if for Christmas, for an oc- 
casion more serious than Christmas even, since now and at 
last this ogre or djinn had agreed for the sake of the wife and 
the children to come to church, to permit hem at least to 
approach he vicinity of salvation, to at least give EDen one 
chance to struggle wih him for hose children’s souls on a 
battleground where she could be supported not only by 
Heaven but by her own femily and people of her own kind; 
yes, even for he moment submitting himself to redemption, 
or lacking hat^ at least chivalrous for he instant even hough 
still unr^enerate. Ihat is what I expected. This is what I saw 
as I stood here before he church between papa and our aunt 
and waited for he carri^p to arrive from he twdve-mile 
drive. And hough I must have seen Ellen and he drildren 
before his, his is he vision of my first sight of hem which 
1 shall carry to my grave: a glimpse like he forefront of a 
tornado, of he carris^e and Ellen s high white face within it 
and he two replicas of his face in miniature flanking her, and 
on he front seat he face and teeh of he wild negro who was 
•driving, and he, his free exactly like he negro’s save for he 
teeh (his became of his beard, doubtless) — ^all in a 'hunder 
and a firry of wildeyed horses and of galloping and of dust. 

“Oh, hoe were penty of hem to abeit him, a»ist idm,

make a race of it; ten oclock on Sunday morning, the car- 
riage racing on two wheels up to the very door to the churdi 
with that wild n^o in his Christian dolhes looking exactly 
like a per&amp;rming tiger in a linen duster and a top hat, and 
Ellen with no drop of blood in her face, holding those two 
children who were not crying and who did not need to be 
held, who sat on either si^ of her, perfeoly still too, with 
in their faces that infantile enormity whidh we did not then 
quite comprehend. Oh, yes, there were plenty to aid and 
abet him; even he could not have held a horse race withoiW: 
someone to race against Because it was not even public opin- 
ion that stopped him, not even the men who m%ht have 
had wives and children in carriages to be ridden down and 
into ditches: it was the minister himself speaking in the 
name of the women of Jefferson and Yoknapatawpha County. 
So he quit coming to church himself; now it would be just 
Ellen and the children in the carriage on Sunday morning, 
so we knew now that at least there would be no betting now, 
since no one could say if it was an actual race or not, since 
now, with his fiice absent, it was only the wild negro’s per- 
fectly intorutable one with the teeth glinting a litde, so that 
now we could never know if it were a race or a runaway, 
and if there was triumph, it wa? on the face twelve miles 
bach there at Sutpen’s Hundred, which did not even require 
to sec or be present. It was the negro now, who in the act of 
passing another carriage spoke to that team too as well as to 
his own — something widiout words, not needing words 
probably, in that tongue in which they slept in the mud'dT 
that swamp and brought here out of whatever dark swamp 
he had found them in and brought them here — ^the dust, the 
thtmder, the carriage whirling up to the churdi door while 
women and children mattered and scrtomed before it and 
men caught at the bridles of the other team. And the n^ro 



■wotiid let E&amp;en and the children out at the door and take 
the carriage on suround to the hitching grove and beat the 
horses for running away; there was even a fool who tried to 
interfere once, whaeupon die negro turned upon him with 
die stick lifted and his teeth diowing a little and said, ‘Mars- 
ter say; I do. You tell Marster.* 

“Yes. From them; from themselves. And this time it was 
not even the minister. It was Ellen- Our aunt and papa were 
t a l king and I came in and my aunt said ‘Go out and play,’ 
diough even if I could not have heard through the door at 
all, I could have repeated die conversation for them: ‘Your 
daughter, your own dai^hter’ my aunt said; and papa: *Yes. 
She is my daughter. When she wants me to interfere she will 
tell me so hersdf’ Because this Sunday when Ellen and the 
childr^ came out of the front door, it was not the carri^ 
waiting, it was Ellen’s phaeton with the old gende mare 
which she drove and the stabkboy that he had bot^ht in- 
stead of the wild negro. And Judith looked once at the phae- 
ton and realiaed what it meant and began to scream, scream- 
ing and kicking while they carried her back into the house 
and put hex to bed. No, he was not present Nor do I claim 
a lurking triumphant free behind a window curtain. Prob- 
ably he would have been as amazed as we were since we 
would all realize now diat we were feced by more than a 
child’s tantrum or even hysteria: that his free had beoi in 
that carriage all the time; thatithadbeaiJudiih,agirlofsbc, 
vdio had inst^ated and authorized that n^o to make the 
team run away. Not Henry, mind; not the boy, which, woidd 
have been outrageous enough; butjudith, the girl , , 
“As socm as papa and I entered those gates tl^t afremoon 
and began to go up the drive toward the house, I could fed 
k. It was as though somewhere in that Sunday afternoon’s 
^niet and peace the screams of that dbdd still existed, lingoed, 

25 



not as sotmd now but as something for the skin to hear, the 
hair on the head to hear. But I did not ask at once. I was just 
four then; I sat in the buggy beside papa as I had stood be- 
tween him and our aunt before tie church on that first Sun- 
day when I had been dressed to come and see my sister and 
my nephew and niece for the first time, looking at the house. 
I had been inside it before too, of course, but even when I 
saw it for foe first time that I could remember I seemed al- 
ready to know how it was going to look just as I seemed to 
know how Ellen and Judith and Henry would look before I 
saw them for foe time which I always remember as being 
foe first No, not asking even then, but just looking at that 
huge quiet house, saying ‘What room is Judith sick in, papa?’ 
with that quiet aptitude of a &lt;foild for accepting foe inexpli- 
cable, though I now know that even, then I was wondering 
what Judith saw when she came out foe door and found foe 
phaeton instead of foe carriage, foe tame stableboy instead of 
foe wild man; what she had seen in dut phaeton whkh 
looked so ionocent to foe rest of us — or worse, what she had 
missed when she saw foe phaeton and began to scream. Yes, 
a still hot quiet Sunday iftemoon like this afternoon; I re- 
member yet foe utter quiet of that house when we went in 
and from which I knew at once that he was absent without 
knowing that he would now be in foe scuppemong arbor 
drinking with Wash Jones. I only knew, as soon as papa and 
I crossed foe threfoold, that he was not there: as though vdfo 
some almost omniscient conviction, knowing that he did not 
need to stay and observe his triumph — ^and that, in compari- 
son with what was to be, this one was a mere trivial business 
even beneath our notice too. Yes, that quiet darkened room 
with foe blinfo dosed and a Negro woman sitting beside foe 
bed with a fen and Judith’s white fece on the pillow beneafo 
a camphor doth, adeep as I supposed then: possibly it was

sleep, or would be called sleep: and EHen’s fece white and 
calm and papa said ‘Go out and find Henry and ask him to 
play widi you, Rosa' and so I stood just outside that quiet 
door in that quiet upper hah because I was afiraid to go away 
even from it, because I could hear the sabbadi afternoon quiet 
of that house louder than thunder, louder than laughing even 
with triumph. 

“ ‘ Think of the children,’ papa said. 

“ ‘Thinks’ Ehen said. “Wliat dbe do I do? What else do I 
lie awake at night and do but think of diems’ Neither papa 
nor Ehen said: Come back home. No: This occurred before 
it became fashionable to repair your mistakes by turning 
your back on them and running. It was Just the two quiet 
voices beyond that blank door which might have been dis- 
cussing something printed in a magazine; and I, a child stand- 
ing close beside that door because I was afiraid to be there 
but more afiraid to leave it, standing motionless beside that 
door as though trying to make myself blend with the dark 
wood and become invisible, like a chamdeon, listening to 
the living spirit, presence, of that house, since some of Ehm’s 
life and breath had now gone into it as weh as his, breathing 
away in a long neutral sound of victory and despair, of tri- 
umph and terror too. 

“‘Do you love this . . . ’ papa said. 

“ ‘Papa.’ Ellen said. That was all. But I could see her fiice 
then as clearly as papa could have, with that same expression 
which it had worn in the carriage on that first Sunday and 
the others. Then a servant came and said our buggy was 
ready. 

“Yes. Erom themselves. Not firom him, not firom any- 
body, just as nobody could have saved them, even himsdfi 
Because he now showed us why that triumph had been be- 
neath his notice. He show^ Ellen, that is: not me. 1 was not 

27 



thece; it was six years now, during which I had scarcely seen 
him- Our aunt was gone now and I was keeping house for 
papa. Perhaps once a year papa and I would go out there and 
have dinner, and maybe four times a year Ellen and the chd- 
dren would come in and spend the day with us. Not he; that 
I know of, he never entered dns house again after he and 
Ellen married- 1 was young then; I was even young enough 
to believe that this was due to some stubborn coal of con- 
science, if not remorse, even in him. But I know better now. 
I know now that it was simply because since papa had given 
him respectability through a wife there was nothing eke he 
could want from papa and so not even sheer gratitude, let 
alone appearances, could force him to forego his own pleas- 
ure to the extent of taking a family meal with his wife’s 
people. So I saw litde of them. I did not have time now to 
play, even if I had ever had any inclination. I had never 
learned how and I saw no reason to try to learn now even if 
I had had the time. 

“So it was six years now, though it was actually no secret 
to Ellen since it had apparently been going on ever since he 
drove the last nail in the house, the only difference between 
now and the time of his bachdorhood being that now they 
would hitch the teanis and saddle hones and mules in the 
grove beyond the stable and so come across the pasture 
unseen from the house. Because there were plenty of them 
still; it was as if God or the devil had taken advantage of his 
very vices in order to supply witnesses to the discharge of 
our curse not only from among gentlefolks, our own kind, 
but from the very scum and riflEir^ who could not have ap- 
proachol the house itself under any other circumstances, not 
even from tiffi rear. Yes, Ellen and those two children alone 
in that house twelve miles from town, and down dbere in the 
stable a hollow square of feces in the kntem light, the white 
as 



feces on three ades, the black ones on the fourth, and in the 
center two of his wild negroes fighting, naked, fighting not 
s&amp; white men fight, with rules and weapons, but as n^roes 
fight to hurt one another quick and bad, Ellen knew that, or 
thought she did; that was not it. She accepted that — ^not rec- 
onciled: accepted — ^as though there is a breathing-point in 
outrage where you can accept it almost with gratitude sinre 
you can say to yourself thank God, this is all; at least I now 
know all of it — thinking that, clinging still to that when she 
ran into the stable that night while the very men who had 
stolen into it firom the rear fell back away firom her with at 
least some grain of decency, and Ellen seeing not the two 
black beasts she had expected to see but instead a white one 
and a black one, both naked to the waist and gouging at one 
another’s eyes as if they should not only have been the same 
color, but diould have been covered with fur too. Y«. It 
seems that on certain occasions, perhaps at the end of the 
evening, the spectacle, as a grand finale or perhaps as a mat- 
ter of sheer deadly forethought toward the retention of su- 
premacy, domination, he would enter the ring wtith one of 
the negroes himsdf. Yes. That’s what Eflen saw: her hmband 
and the father of her childrai standing there naked and pant- 
ing and bloody to the waist and (he negro just feUen evident- 
ly, lying at hh feet and bloody too, save (hat on the negro 
it merdy looked like grease or sweat— EHen running down 
the hill from the hou^, bareheaded, in time to hear the 
sound, the screaming, hearing it while she still ran in the 
darkness and before the spectators knew (hat she was there, 
hearing it even before it occurred to one spectator to say, 
Tt’s a horse’ thm ‘It’s a wroman’ then *My God, it’ s a diild’ — 
ran in, and the spectators felling back to permit her to sec 
Henry plun^ out firom among the negroes who had been 
holding him, screamit^ and vomiting-not pausing, not 



even lookup at the faces which shrank back away from her 
as she knelt in the stable filth to raise Henry and not looking 
at Henry eitier but up at him as he stood there with even his 
teeth showing beneath his beard now and another negro wip- 
ing the blood from his body with a towsacL ‘I know you 
will excuse us, gentlemen,’ Men said. But they were already 
departing, nigger and white, slinking out again as they had 
slunk in, and EUen not watchii^ them now either but kneel- 
ing in the dirt while Henry dung to her, crying, and he 
standing there yet while a third nigger prodded his shirt or 
coat at him as though the coat were a stick and he a caged 
snake, ‘Where is Judith, Thomase* Ellen said, 

“ ‘Judith?’ he said. Oh, he was not lying; his own triumph 
had outrun him; he had builded even better in evil than even 
he could have hoped. ‘Judith? Isn’t she in bed?’ 

“‘Don’t lie to me, Thomas,’ Ellen said. ‘I can understand 
your bringing Hairy here to see this, wanting Henry to see 
this; I will try to understand it; yes, I will make myself try 
to understand it. But not Judith, Thomas. Not my baby girh 
Thomas.’ 

“‘I dont expect you to understand it,’ he said. ‘Because 
you are a woman. But I didn’t bring Judith down here. I 
would not briDg her down here. I dont e:^ect you to believe 
that. But I swear to it’ 

“‘I wish I could believe you,’ EUen said. ‘I want to bdlkve 
you.’ Then she began to caEL ‘Judithl’ she called in a voice 
calm and sweet and filled with despair: ‘Judith honey ! Time 
to come to bed,’ 

“But I was not there. I was not there to see the two Sutpen 
faces this time — once on Judith and once on the negro girl 
beside her— -looking down through the square entrance to 
the loft.”

* II * 


It was a summer of wistaria. The &lt;wil%ht was full of 
it and of tlie smell of his fadier’s cigar as they sat on tie front 
gallery after supper until it would be time for Quentin to 
start, while in the deep shaggy lawn bdow tie veranda tie 
fireflies blew and drifted in soft random — ^tie odor, the scent, 
which five months later Mr Compson s letter would carry 
up firom Mississippi and over the long iron New England 
snow and into Quentin’s sitting-room at Harvard. It was a 
day of listening too — ^tie listening, the hearing in 1909 most- 
ly about that which he aieady knew, since he had been bom 
in and stiU breathed tie same air in which tie church bells 
had rung on that Sunday morning in 1833 st^d, on Sundays, 
heard even one of the original three bells in the same steeple 
where descendants of the same pigeons sttutted and crooned 
or wheeled in short courses resembling soft fluid paint- 
smears on the soft summer sky. That Sunday mor n i n g in 
June with the bells ringing peaceful and peremptory and a 
littb cacophonous — ^the denominations in concord thou^ 
not in tune — and the ladies and children, and house negroes 
to carry the parasols and fl[3rwhisks, and even a few man (the 
ladies moving in hoops sunong the miniature broadcloth of 
little boys and the pantalettes of little girls, in the skirts of the 
time when ladies did not walk but floated) when the other 
men sitting with thdr feet on the railing of the Holston House 
gallery looked up, and there the stranger was. He was already 

31 



halfway across the Square when they saw him, on a big hard- 
ridden roan horse, man and beast looking as though they had 
been created out of thin air and set doTsm in the bright sum- 
mer sabbath sunshine in the middle of a tired foxtrot — face 
and horse that none of them had ever seen before, name that 
none of them had ever heard, and origin and purpose which 
some of them were never to learn. So that in die next four 
w^ks 0efferson was a village then: the Holston House, the 
courthouse, six stores, a blacksmith and livery stable, a saloon 
frequented by drovers and peddlers, three churches and per- 
haps thirty residences) the stranger’s name went back and 
forth among the places of business and of idleness and among 
the residences in steady strophe and antistrophe: Sutpen. Sut- 
pen. Sutpen. Sutpen. 

That was all that the town was to know about him for al- 
most a month. He had apparendy come into town from the 
south— a man of about twenty-five as die town learned later, 
because at the time his age could not have been guessed be- 
cause he looked like a man who had been side. Not like a 
man who had been peacefully ill in bed and had recovered 
to move with a sort of diffident and tentative amazemoit 
in a world which he had bdieved himself on the point of 
surrendering, but like a man who had been through some 
solitary furnace experience which was more than just fever, 
Bke an explorer say, who not only had to face the normal 
hardship of the pursuit which he chose but was overtaken by 
theaddedandunforeseen handicap of the fever also and fought 
through it at enormous cost not so much physical as mental, 
alone and unaided and not through blind instinctive will to 
endure and survive but to gain and keep to enjoy it the ma- 
terial pria: for which he accepted the original gambit. A man 
with a big frame but gaunt now almost to emaciation, with a 
short reddish beard which resembled a disguise and above 

33 



which las pale eyes had a quality at once visionary and alert, 
ruthless and reposed in a Btce whose flesh had the appearance 
of pottery, of having been colored by that oven’s fever cither 
of soul or environment, deeper than sun alone beneath a dead 
impervious surface as of glazed clay. That was what they 
saw, though it was years before the town learned that that 
was all which he possessed at the time — the strong spent 
horse and the clothes on his back and a small saddlebag 
scarcely large enough to contain the spare linen and the ra- 
zors, and the two pistols of which Miss Coldfield told Quai- 
tin, with the butts worn smooth as pickhandles and which he 
used with the precision of knitting needles; later Quentin’s 
grandfather saw him ride at a canter around a sapling at 
twenty feet and put both bullets into a playing card fastened 
to the tree. He had a room in the Holston House but he car- 
ried the key with him and each morning he fed and saddled 
the horse and rode away before dayl%ht, where to the town 
likewise failed to learn, probably due to the fact diat he gave 
die pistol demonstration on the diird day after his arrival. So 
they had to depend on inquiry to find out what they could 
about him, which would of necessity be at night, at the sup- 
per table in the Holston House dining-room or in die lounge 
which he would have to cross to gain his room and lock die 
door again, which he would do as soon as he finished eating. 
The bar opened into the lounge too, and that would or should 
nave been the place to accost him and even inquire, accept 
for the fiict that he did not use the bar. He did- not drink at 
all, he told them. He did not say that he used to drink and 
had quit, nor that he had nevra used alcohol He just said that 
he would not care for a drink; it was years later before even 
Quentin’s grandfother (he was a young man too then; it 
would be years yet before he would become Genaral Comp- 
sbn) learned ^t the reason Sutpen did not drink was that he 



did not have the money with which to pay his diare or return 
the courtesy; it was General Compson who first realized that 
at this time Sutpen lacked not only the money to spend for 
dnnk and conviviality, but the time and inclination as well: 
that he was at this time completely the slave of his secret and 
furious impatience, his conviction gained firom whatever 
that recent experience had been — that fever mental or phys- 
ical — of a need for haste, of time fledng beneath him, which 
was to drive him for the next five years — ^as General Comp- 
son computed it, roughly until about nine months before his 
son was bom. 

So they woidd catch him, run him to earth, in the lounge 
between the supper table and his locked door to give him the 
opportunity to teE them who he was and where he came 
firom and what he was up to, whereupon he would move 
gradually and steadily until his back came in contact with 
something — a. post or a wall — and then stand there and tell 
them nothing whatever as pleasantly and courteously as a 
hotel clerk. It was the Chickasaw Indian agent with or through 
whom he dealt and so it was not until he waked the County 
Recorder that Saturday n%ht with the deed, patent, to the 
land and the gold Spanish coin, that the town learned that he 
now owned a hundred square miles of some of the best virgin 
bottom Imd in the country, though even that knowledge 
came too late because Sutpen himself was gone, where to 
again they did not know. But he owned land among them 
now and some of them began to suspect what General Comp- 
son apparently knew: that the Spanish coin with which he 
had paid to have his patent recorded was the last one of any 
kind which he possessed. So they were certain now that he 
had departed to get more; there were several who even an- 
ticipated in beheving (and even in saying aloud, now that he 
wasi not presoit) what Sutpen’s future and then unborn sis- 

34 



ter-in-law was to tell Quentin almost eighty years later; that 
he had found some umque and practical way of hiding loot 
and that he had returned to the cache to replenish his pock- 
ets, even if he had not actually ridden with the two pistols 
back to the River and the steamboats full of gamblers and 
cotton- and slavedealers to replenish the cache- At least some 
of them were telling one another that when two months later 
he returned, agam without warning and accompanied this 
time by the covered wagon with a negro driving it and on 
the seat with the negro a small, alertly resigned man with a 
grim, harried Latin face, in a frock coat and a flowered waist- 
coat and a hat which would have created no furore on a Pans 
boulevard, all of which he was to wear constandy for the 
next two years — ^the somberly theatric clothing and the ex- 
pression of fatalistic and amazed determination — while his 
white client and the negro crew which he was to advise 
though not direct went stark naked save for a coating of 
dried mud. This was the French architat. Years later the 
town learned that he had come aU the way from Martinique 
on Sutpen’s bare promise and lived for two years on venison 
cooked over a campfire, in an unfloored tent made of the 
wagon hood, before he so much as saw any color or shape of 
pay. And until he passed through town on his way back to 
New Orleans two years later, he was not even to see Jefferson 
again; he would not come, or Sutpen would not bring him, 
to town even on the few occasions when Sutpen would be 
seen diere, and he did not have much chance to look at Jef- 
ferson on that first day because the wagon did not stop. Ap- 
parently it was only by sheer geographical hap that Sutpen 
passed through town at all, pausing only long enough for 
someone (not General Compson) to look beneath the wagon 
hood and into a black tunnel filled with still eyeballs and 
smelling like a wolfilen- 


35 



But the legend of Sutpen’s wild negroes was not to begin 
at once, because the wagon went on as though even die 
wood and iron which composed it, as well as the mules 
which drew it, had become imbued by sheer association with 
him with that quality of gaunt and tireless driving, that con- 
viction for haste and of fleeing dme; later Sutpen told Quen- 
tin’s grandfiither that on that afternoon when the wagon pas- 
sed through Jefierson they had been without food since the 
previous night and that he was trying to reach Sutpen’s Hun- 
dred and the river bottom to try to kill a deer before dark, so 
he and the architect and the negroes would not have to spend 
another night without food. So the legend of the wild men 
came gradually back to town, brought by the men who 
would ride out to watch what was going on, who began to 
tell how Sutpen would take stand beside a game trail with 
the pistols and send the negroes in to drive the swamp like a 
pack of hounds; it was they who told how during diat first 
summer and fall the negroes did not even have (or did not 
use) blankets to sleep in, even before the coon-hunter Akers 
claimed to have walked one of them out of the absolute mud 
like a sleeping alligator and screamed just in time. The ne- 
groes couM speak no English yet and doubtless there were 
more than Akers who did not know that the language in 
which they and Sutpen communicated was a sort of Fraidh 
and not some dark and fatal tongue of their own. 

There were many more than Akers, though the others 
were responsible citizens and landowners and so did not have 
to lurk about the camp at night. In fact, as Miss Qaldfield 
tdd Quentin, they would make up parties to meet at the 
Holston House and go out horseback, often carrying lunch. 
Sutpen had built a bride kiln and he had set up the saw and 
planer which he had brought in the w^on—a capstan with a 
long sapling walking-beam, with the wagon team and the 



Q£gro» in shifts and himsdf too when necessary, when the 
machinery slowed, hitched to it— as if the negroes actually 
were wild mai; as General Compson told his son, Quoitin’s 
father, while the negroes were working Sutpen never raised 
his voice at diem, that instead he led them, caught them at 
the psychological instant by example, by some ascendancy of 
forbearanre rather than by brute fear. Without dismounting 
(usually Sutpen did not even greet them with as much as a 
nod, apparendy as unaware of their presence as if they had 
been idle shades) they would sit in a curious quiet dump as 
diough for mutual protection and watch his mansion rise, 
carried plank by plank and brick by brick out of the swamp 
where the clay and timber waited — ^the bearded white man 
and the twenty black ones and all stark naked beneath the 
croaching and pervading mud. Being men, these spectators 
did not realize that the garments which Sutpen had worn 
when he first rode into Jefferson were the only ones in which 
they had ever seen him, and few of the women in the county 
had seen him at all. Otherwise, some of them would have an- 
ticipated Miss Coldfield in this too: in divining that he was 
saving his dothes, since decorum even if not elegance of ap- 
pearance would be the only weapon (or rather, ladder) widi 
which he could conduct the last assault upon what Miss 
Coldfield and perhaps others believed to be respectability — 
that respectability which, according to Generd Compson, 
consisted in Sutpen’s secret mind of a great deal more than 
the mere acquisition of a chatelaine for his house. So he and 
die twenty negroes worked together, plastered over with 
mud against the mosquitoes and, as Miss Coldfield told 
Quentin, distinguishable one from another by his beard and 
eyes alone and only the architect resembling a human crea- 
ture because of the French clothes which he wore constantly 
with a sort of invincible &amp;tality until the day after the house 

37 



-was completed save for tihe windowgiass and the ironware 
which they could not make by hand and the architect de- 
parted-working in the sun and heat of summer and the mud 
and ice of winter, with quiet and unflagging fury. 

It took him two years, he and his crew of imported slaves 
which his adopted fellow citizens still looked on as being a 
good deal more deadly than any beast he could have started 
and slain in that country- They worked from sunup to sun- 
down while parties of horsemen rode up and sat their horses 
quietly and watched, and the architect in his formal coat and 
his Paris hat and his expression of grim and embittered amaze- 
ment lurked about the envirom of the scene with his air 
something between a casual and bitterly disinterested specta- 
tor and a condemned and conscientious ghost — ^amazement. 
General Compson said, not at the others and what they were 
doing so much as at himself, at the inexpUcable and incredi- 
ble fact of his own presence. But he was a good architect; 
Quentin knew the house, twelve miles from J^efferson, in its 
grove of cedar and oak, seventy-five years after it was fin- 
ished. And not only an architect, as General Compson said, 
but an artist since only an artist could have borne those two 
years in order to build a house which he doubdess not only 
espected but firmly intended never to see sgain. Not, Gen- 
eral Compson said, the hardsMp to sense and the outrage to 
sensibility of the two years’ sojourn, but Sutpen: that only an 
artist could have borne Sutpen’s ruthlessness and hurry and 
still manage to curb the dream of grim and casddike magnif- 
icence at wBch Sutpen obviously aimed, sin&lt;» the place as 
Sutpen planned it would have been, almost as lar^ as Jefier- 
son itself at the time; that the litde grim harried fore%ner 
had singlehanded given batde to and vanquished Sutpen’s 
fierce and overweening vanity or desire for nmgnificence or 
for vindicatioii or whatever it was (even General Compson 
38 



did not know yet) and so created of Sutpen’s very defeat the 
victory which, in conquering, Sutpen himself would have 
failed to gain. 

So it was finished then, down to the last plank and brick 
and v/ooden pin which they could make thenaelves. Un- 
painted and unfurnished, without a pane of glass or a door- 
knob or hinge in it, twelve miles from town and almost that 
far from any neighbor, it stood for three years more sur- 
rounded by its formal gardens and promenades, its slave 
quarters and stables and smokehouses; wild turkey ranged 
within a mile of the house and deer came hght and colored 
like smoke and left delicate prints in the formal beds where 
there would be no flowers for four years yet. Now there be- 
gan a period, a phase, during which the town and the county 
watched him with more puzzlement yet. Perhaps it was be- 
cause the next step toward that secret end which General 
Compson claimed to have known but which the town and 
the county comprehaided but dimly or not at all, now re- 
quired patience or passive time instead of that driving fury to 
which he had accustomed them; now it was the womai who 
first suspected what he wanted, v/hat the next step would be. 
None of the men, certainly not those who knew him well 
enough to call him by name, suspected that he wanted a wife. 
Doubtless there were some of them, hmbands and bachelors 
both, who not only would have refused to entertain die idea 
but would even have protested gainst it, because for the 
next thr« yeare he led what must have been to them a per- 
fect existence. He hved out there, eight miles from any neigh- 
bor, in masculine solitude in what might be called the h^ 
acre gunroom of a baronial splendor. He lived in the Spartan 
shell c£ the largest edifice in the county, not excepting the 
courthouse itself, whose threshold no woman had so much 
as seal, without any feminized softness of window-pane or 

39 



door or mattress; where there vras not only no woman to 
ohject if he should elect to have his dogs in to sleep on the 
pallet bed with him, he did not even need dogs to hill the 
game which left footprints within sight of the kitchen door 
but hunted it instead with human beings who belonged to 
him body and soul and of whom it was believed (or said) 
that they could creep up to a bedded buck and cut its throat 
before it could move. 

It was at this time that he began to invite the parties of men 
of which Miss Coldfield told Quentin, out to Sutpen’s Hun- 
dred to camp in blankets in the naked rooms of his embry- 
onic formal opulence; they hunted, and at night played cards 
and drank, and on occasion he doubtless pitted his negroes 
against one another and perhaps even at this time participated 
now and then himselft— that spectade which, according to 
Miss Coldfield, his son was unable to bear the sight of while 
his daughter looked on unmoved. Sutpen drank himself now, 
though there were probably others besides Quentin’s grand- 
father who remarked that he drank very sparingly save when 
he himself had managed to supply some of the liquor. His 
guests would bring whiskey out with them but he drank of 
this with a sort of sparing calculation as thot^h keeping men- 
tally, General Compson said, a sort of balance of spiritual sol- 
vency between the amount of whiskey he accepted and the 
amount of running meat which he supplied to the guns. 

He lived like that for three years. He now had a plantation; 
inside of two years he had dragged house and gardens out of 
virgin swamp, and plowed and planted his land with seed 
cotton which General Compson loaned him. Then he seemed 
to quit, fife seemed to just sit down in the middle of what 
he had almost fibi^ied, and to remain so for three years dur- 
ing which he did not even appear to intaid or want any- 
th^ more. Pohaps it is not to be wondored at that the 
, 40 



men in the county came to believe that the life he now led 
had beai his aim all die time; it was Genial Compson, who 
seemed to have known him well enough to ofifec to lend him 
seed cotton for his start, who knew any better, to whom 
Sutpen ever told anything about his past. It was General 
Compson who knew first about the Spanish coin being his 
last one, as it was Compson (so the town learned later) who 
offered to lend Sutpen the money to finish and fiumish his 
house, and was refused. So doubdess General Comfson was 
the first man in the county to teU himself that Sutpen did not 
need to borrow money with which to complete the house, 
supply what it yet lacked, because he intended to marry it. 
Not the first person to know: rather the first man, since, ac- 
cording to what Miss Coldfield told Quentin seventy-five 
years later, the women in the county had been telling one 
another and their husbands as well that Sutpen did not in- 
tend to quit there, that he had already gone to too much 
trouble, gone through too much privation and hardsh^, to 
setde down and live exacdy as he had lived while the house 
was being built save that now he had a roof to sleep undo: in 
place of an unfloored w£^on hood. Probably the women had 
already cast about among the femilies of the men who m%ht 
now be called hk friends, for that prospective bride whose 
dowry might complete the shape and substance of that re- 
spectability Miss Coldfidd anyway believed to be his aim. So 
when, at the expiration of this second phase, three years aScsx 
the house was finished and the architect departed, and again 
on Sunday morning and again without warning, the town 
saw him cxcss the square, on foot now but in the same gar- 
mmts in which he had ridden into town five years ago and 
which no one had seen since 0ie or one of the negroes had 
ironed the coat with heated bricks. General Compson told 
Quentin’s fether) and ento: the .Methodist church, &lt;^y sonm 

41 



of the men were surprised. The women merely said that he 
had exhausted the possibilities of the femilies of the men with 
whom he had hunted and gambled and that he had now 
come to town to find a wife exactly as he would have gone 
to the Memphis market to buy livestock or slaves. But when 
they comprehended whom it was that he had apparently 
come to town and into church to invest with his choice, the 
assurance of the women became one with the men’s surprise, 
and then even more than that: amazement. 

Because the town now believed that it knew him. For two 
years it had watched him as with that grim and unflagging 
firry he had erected that shcH of a house and laid out his 
fields, then for three years he had remained completely static, 
as if he were run by electricity and someone had come 
along and removed, dismanded the wiring or the dynamo. 
So that when he entered the Methodist church that Sunday 
morning in his ironed coat, there were men as well as women 
who believed that they had only to look around the congrega- 
tion in order to anticipate the direction his feet would take 
him, until they became aware that he had apparendy marked 
down jNfiiss Coldfield’s father with the same cold and ruth- 
less dehberation with which he had probably marked down 
the French architect. They watched in shocked amazement 
while he laid deliberate siege to the one man in the town 
with whom he could have had nothing in common, least of 
all, money — z man who obviously could do nothing under 
the stm for him save give him credit at a littfe cross-roads 
store or cast a vote in his favor if he diould ever seek ordina- 
tion as a Methodist minister — z Methodist steward, a mer- 
chant not only of modest position and circumstances but who 
already had a wife and family of his own, let alone a depend- 
ent mother and sister, to support out of the proceeds of a 
buriness which he had brot^ht to J^erson ten years ago in 

42 



a single wagon — a man with a name for absolute and undc- 
viatmg and even Puritan uprightness in a country and time 
of lawless opportunity, who neither drank nor gambled nor 
even hunted. In their surprise they forgot that Mr Coldfield 
had a marriageable daughter. They did not consider the 
daughter at all. They did not think of love in connection 
with Sutpen. They thought of ruthlessness rather than justice 
and of fear rather than respect, but not of pity or love: be- 
sides being too lost m amazed speculation as to just how Sut- 
pen intended or could contrive to use Mr Coldfield to fur- 
ther whatever secret ends he still had. They were never to 
know: even Miss Rosa Coldfield did not. Because from that 
day there were no more huntmg parties out at Sutpen’s Hun- 
dred, and when they saw him now it would be in town. But 
not loafing, idlmg. The men who had slept and matched 
glasses with him under his roof (some of them had even 
come to call him Sutpen without the formal Mister) watched 
him pass along the street before the Holston House with a 
single formal gesture to his hat and go on and enter Mr 
Coldfield’s store, and that was aU, 

“Then one day he quitted Jefferson for the second time,” 
Mr Compson told Quentin. “The town should have been 
accustomed to that by now. Nevertheless, his position had 
subtly changed, as you will see by the town’s reaction to this 
second return. Because when he came back this time, he was 
in a sense a pubhc enemy. Perhaps this was because of what 
he brought back with him this time: the material he brought 
back this time, as compared to the simple wagonload of wild 
niggers which he had brought back before. But I dont think 
so. That is, I think it was a little more involved than the sheer 
value of his chandeliers and mahogany and rugs. I think that 
the affront was bom of the town’s realization that he was get- 
ting it involved with himself; that whatever the felony which 

43 



product the mahogany and crystal, he was forcing the town 
to compound it. Heretofore, until that Sunday when he came 
to church, if he had misused or injured anybody, it was only 
old Ikkemotubbe, foom whom he got his land — a matter be- 
tween his conscience and Uncle Sam and God. But now his 
position had changed, because when, about three months 
after he departed, four wagons left jefterson to go to the 
River and meet him, it was known that Mr Coldfield was the 
man who hired and dispatched them. They were big wagons, 
drawn by oxen, and when they returned the town looked at 
them and knew, no matter what they might have contained, 
that Mr Coldfield could not have mortgaged everything that 
he owned for enough to fill them; doubtless this time there 
were more men than women even who pictured him during 
this absence with a handkerchief over his foce and the two 
pistol barrels glinting benealh the candelabra of a steamboat’s 
saloon, even if no worse: if not something performed in the 
lurking dark of a muddy landing and with a knife from be- 
hind. They saw him pass, on the roan horse beside his four 
wagons; it seems that even the ones who had eaten his food 
and diot his game and even called him ‘Sutpen’ without the 
‘Mister,’ didn’t accost him now. They just waited while re- 
ports and rumors came bade to town of how he and his now 
somewhat tamed negroes had installed the "svindows and 
doors and the spits and pots in the kitchen and the crystal 
chandeliers in the parlors and the furniture and the curtains 
and the rugs; it was that same Akers who had blundered on- 
to the mudcouched negro five years ago who came, a little 
wild-eyed and considerably slack-mouthed, into he Holston 
House bar one evening and said, ‘Boys, this time he stole the 
whole dum steamboatl’ 

“So at last dvic virtue came to a boEL One day and wih 
he hoiff of the county amoi^ hem,a party of dght or ten 

44 



took the road out to Sutpen’s Hundred. They did not go all 
the way because about six miles from town they met Sutpen 
himself He was ridmg the roan horse, in the frock coat and 
the beaver hat v/hich they knew and with his legs wrapped 
m a piece of tarpauhn; he had a portmanteau on Ms pommel 
and he was carrying a small woven basket on his arm. He 
stopped the roan (it was April then, and the road was still a 
quagmire) and sat there in his splashed tarpaulin and looked 
from one face to the next; your grandfather said that his eyes 
looked like pieces of a broken plate and that his beard was 
strong as a curry-comb. That was how he put it: strong as a 
curry-comb. ‘Good morning, gentlemen,’ he said. ‘Were 
you looking for me?’ 

“Doubtless sometlung more than this transpired at the 
time, though none of the vigilance committee ever told it 
that I know of. All I ever heard is how the town, the men on 
the gallery of the Holston House saw Sutpen and the com- 
mittee ride onto the square together, Sutpen a little in front 
and the others bunched behind him — ^Sutpen with his legs 
and feet wrapped neatly in his tarpaulin and his shoulders 
squared inside the worn broadclodi coat and that worn 
brushed beaver cocked a little, talking to them over his 
shoulder and those eyes hard and pale and reckless and prob- 
ably quizzical and maybe contemptuous even Aen. He pulled 
up at the door and Ae negro hosder ducked out and took the 
roan’s head and Sutpen got down, wiA his portmanteau and 
the basket and mounted Ae steps, and I heard how he turned 
Acre and looked at Aem again where they huddled on Aeir 
horses, not knowing what to do exactly. And it might have 
been a good Aing that he had Aat beard and they could not 
see his mouth. Then he turned, and he looked at Ae oAer 
men sitting wi A Aeir feet on Ae railing and watching him 
too, men who used to come out to his place and sleep on Ae 

45 



floor and hunt with him, and he saluted them with that florid, 
swaggering gesture to the hat (yes, he was underbred. It 
showed like this always, your grandfather said, in all his 
formal contacts with people. He was like John L. Sullivan 
having taught himself painfully and tediously to do die schot- 
tische, having drilled himself and drilled hiimelf in secret un- 
til he now believed it no longer necessary to count the music’s 
heat, say. He may have believed that your grandfather or 
Judge Benbow might have done it a litde more effordessly 
than he, but he would not have believed that anyone could 
have beat him in knowing when to do it and how. And be- 
sides, it was in his face; that was where his power lay, your 
grandfather said: that anyone could look at him and say, 
Ciuen the oaasion and the need, this man can and will do any- 
^ing). Then he went on into the house and commanded a 
dbamber. 

“So they sat on their horses and waited for him. I suppose 
they knew that he would have to come out some time: I sup- 
pose they sat there and thought about those two pistols. Be- 
cause there was still no warrant for him, you see: it was just 
public opinicKi in an acute state of indigestion; and now other 
horsemen rcwle into the square and became aware of the situa- 
tion, so that there was quite a posse waiting when he walked 
out onto the gallery. He wore a new hat now, and a new 
broadcloth coat, so they knew what the portmanteau had 
contained. They evai knew now what the basket had con- 
tained because he did not have that with him now either. 
Doubtless at the time it merely puzzled them more than ever, 
because, you see, they had been too busy speculating on just 
bow he was planning to use Mr Coldfield and, since his re- 
turn, too completely outraged by (he belief that they now 
saw the results even if the means were still an enigma, to ro- 
nasmber about Miss ^len at all 

4^ 



“So he stopped again doubtless and looked from face to 
face again, doubtless memorizmg the new faces, without any 
haste, with sail the beard to hide "whatever his mouth might 
have shown. But he seems to have said nothing at all this 
ame. He just descended the steps and walked on across the 
square, the committee (your grandfather said it had grown 
to almost fifty by nov/) moving too, following him across 
the square. They say he did not even look back. He just 
walked on, erect, with the new hat cocked and carrying in 
his hand now that which must have seemed to them the final 
gratuitous insult, with the committee riding along in the 
street beside him and not quite parallel, and otheis who did 
not happen to have horses at the moment joining in and fol- 
lowing the committee in the road, and ladies and dbildren 
and women slaves coming to the doors and windows of the 
homes as they passed to watch as they went on in grim tab- 
leau, and Sutpen, stiU without once looking back, mtered 
Mr Coldfield’s gate and strode on up the brick walk to die 
door, carrying his newspaper cornucopia of dowers. 

“They waited for him ^ain. The crowd was growing £ast 
now — other men and a few boys and even some n^oes 
from the adjacent houses, clotting behind the eight original 
members of the committee who sat watching Mr Coldfield’s 
door until he emerged. It was a good while and he no longer 
carried the flowers, and when he returned to the gate, he was 
engaged to be married. But they did not know this, and as 
soon as he reached the gate, they arrested him. They took 
him back to town, with the ladies and children and house 
niggers watching from behind curtains and behind the shnfl&gt;» 
bery in the yards and the comers of the houses, the kitchens 
where doubtless food was already beginning to scorch, and 
so back to the square where the rest of the able-boched mm 
left their offices and stores to foEow, so that when he reached 

47 



the courthouse, Sutpen had a larger following than if he 
actually had been the runaway slave. They arraigned him be- 
fore a justice, but by that time your grandfather and Mr 
Coldfield had got there. They signed his bond and late that 
afternoon he returned home with Mr Coldfield, walking 
along the same street as of the forenoon, with doubtless the 
same faces watching him from behind the window curtains, 
to the betrothal supper with no wine at table and no whiskey 
before or after. During none of his three passages that day 
through that street did his bearing alter — the same unhurried 
stride to which that new firock coat swung, the same angle 
to the new hat above the eyes and the beard. Your grand- 
father said that some of the faience appearance which the 
flesh of his face had had when he came to town five years 
ago was gone now and that his face had an honest sunburn. 
And he was not fleshier either; your grandfather said that 
•was not it: it was just that the flesh on his bones had become 
quieter, as though passive after some actual breasting of at- 
mosphere like in running, so that he actually filled his clothes 
now, with that quality still swa^ering but •without brag- 
gadocio or belligerence, though according to your grand- 
fiither the quality had never been bdligerence, only watch- 
fulness. And now that was gone, as though after the three 
years he could trust his eyes alone to do the watching, •with- 
out the flesh on his bones standing sentry also. Two months 
later, he and Miss Elian were married. 

“It -was in June of 1838, almost five years to the day firom 
that Sunday morning when he rode into town on the roan 
horse. It (the wedding) was in the same Methodist church 
•where he saw Ellen for the first time, according to Miss Rosa. 
The annt had even forced or nagged (not cooled: that would 
not have done it) Mr Coldfield into allowing Ellen to wear 
^wdar on her &amp;ce for the occasion. The powder •was to hide 



the marks of tears. But before the wedding was over the 
powder was streaked, caked and channelled. Ellen seems to 
have entered the church diat night out of weeping as though 
out of rain, gone through the ceremony and then walked 
back out of the church and into the weeping again, the tears 
again, the same tears even, the same rain. She got into the 
carriage and departed in it (the rain) for Sutpen’s Hundred. 

“It was the wedding which caused the tears: not marrying 
Sutpen. Whatever tears there were for that, granted there 
were tears, came later. It was not intended to be a big wed- 
ding. That is, Mr Coldfield seems not to have intended it to 
be. You will notice that most divorces occur with women 
who were married by tobacco-chewing j.p.’s in country 
courthouses or by ministers waked after midnight, with thek 
suspenders showing beneath their coattails and no collar on 
and a wife or spinster sister in curl papers for wimess. So b 
it too much to believe that these women come to long for 
divorce from a sense not of incompleteness but of actual 
frustration and betrayal? that regardless of the breathing evi- 
dence of children and all else, they still have in their minds 
the image of themselves walking to music and turning heads, 
in all the symbolical trappings and circumstance of cere- 
monial surrender of that which they no longer possess? and 
why not, since to them the actual and authenttc surrender 
can only be (and has been) a ceremony like the breaking of a 
banknote to buy a ticket for the trtih). Of the two men, it 
was Sut^jcn who desired the big wedding, the full chmch and 
all the lituaL I have this from something your grandfather 
let drop one day and which he doubtless had from Sutprai 
himself in the same accidental fashion, since Sutpen never 
even told Ellen that he wanted it, and the fact that at the last 
minute he refused to support her in her desire and insistence 
upon it accounts partly for the tears. Mr Coldfield apparently 

49 



intended to use the diurdi into which he had invested a cer- 
tain amount of sacrifice and doubtless self-denial and cer- 
tainly actual labor and money for the sake of what might be 
called a demand balance of spiritual solvency, exactly as he 
would have used a cotton gin in which he considered him- 
self to have incurred either interest or responsibility, for die 
ginning of any cotton which he or any member of his family, 
by blood or by marriage, had raised — that, and no more. 
Peiiaps his wanting a small wedding was due to the same 
tedious and unremitting husbandry which had enabled him 
to support mother and sister and marry and raise a family on 
the proceeds of that store which ten years ago had fitted into 
a single wagon; or perhaps it was some innate sense of deli- 
cacy and fitness (which his sister and daughter did not seem 
to possess, by the way) regarding the prospective son-in-law 
whom just two months ago he had been instrumental in get- 
ting out of jaU. But it was not due to any lack of courage re- 
garding the son-in-law’s still anomalous position in the town. 
Regardless of what their relations before that had been and 
of what their future relations might be, if Mr Coldfield had 
believed Sutpen guilty at the time of any crime, he would 
not have raised a finger to take Suqiai out. He might not 
have gone out of his way to keep Sutpen in jail, but doubt- 
less the best possible moral fumigation which Sutpen could 
have received at the time in the eyes of his fellow citizens 
was the fact that Mr Coldfield s%ned his bond — something 
he would not have done to save his own good name evm 
thoi^h the arrest had been a direct result of the business be- 
tween himself and Sutpen— -that afl&amp;ir which, when it reached 
a point where his conscience refused, to sanction it, he had 
withdrawn jfiom and let Sutpen take all the profit, refusing 
even to allow Sutpai to rdmburse him for the loss which, in 
withdrawing, he had sufiered, diough he did permit his 



daughter to marry this man of whose actions his conscience 
did not approve. This was the second time he did something 
hke that. 

“When they were married, there were just ten people in 
the church, includmg the weddmg party, of the hundred who 
had been invited, though when they emerged from the 
church (it was at night: Sutpen had brought in ahalWozen 
of his wild negroes to wait at the door with burning pine 
knots) the rest of the hundred were there in the persons of 
boys and youths and men from the drovers’ tavern on the 
edge of town — stock traders and hostlers and such who had 
not been invited. That was the other half of the reason for 
Ellen’s tears. It was the aunt who persuaded or cajoled Mr 
Coldfield into the big wedding. But Sutpen wanted it. He 
wanted, not the anonymous wife and the anonymous chil- 
dren, but the two names, the stainless wife and the unimpeadi- 
able father-in-law, on the license, the patent Yes, patent 
with a gold seal and red ribbons too if that had been practi- 
cable. But not for himself. She (Miss Rosa) would have called 
the gold seal and the ribbons vanity. But then, so had vanity 
conceived that house and, built it in a strange place and with 
little else but his bare hands and further handicapped by the 
chance and probability of meddling interference arising out 
of the disapprobation of all communities of men toward any 
situation which they do not understand. And pride: Miss 
Rosa had admitted that he was brave; parhaps she even al- 
lowed him pride; the same pride which wanted such a house, 
which would accept nothing less, and drove throu^ to get it 
at whatever cost. And then he lived in it, alone, on a pallet 
on the floor for three years until he could fumidi it as it 
diould be furnished— not the least of which fbmidire was 
that wedding license. She was quite right It was not just 
shelter, just anonymous wife and children that he wanted, 

51 



^ist as he did not want just wedding. But when the female 
ctisis came, when. Ellen, and the aunt tried to enlist him on 
dieir side to penuade Mr Coldfield to the big wedding, he 
lefiised to support them. He doubtless ranembemd even bet- 
ter than Mr Coldfield that two months ago he had been in 
jafl; that public opinion which at some momait during dte 
five preceding years had swallowed him even though he 
never had tjuite ever Iain quiet on its stom^h, had performed 
one of mankind’s natural and violent and inexplkable volte- 
foces and regurgitated him. And it did not help him any 
that at least two of the citizens who should have made two 
of the teeth in the outraged jaw served instead as props to 
hold the jaw open and impotent while he walked out of it 
unharmed. 

“Ellen and the aunt remembered this too. The aunt did. 
Being a woman, she was doubtless one of that league of Jcf- 
forson women who on the second day after the town saw 
him five years ago, had agreed never to forgive him for not 
having any past, and who had remained consistent. Since 
the marriage was now a closed incident, she probably looked 
upon it as the one chance not only to secure her niece’s fu- 
ture as his wife, but to justify the action of her brother in 
getting him out of jail and her own position as having ap- 
parently sanctioned and permitted the wedding which iu 
icahty she could not have prevented. It may have been for the 
sake of that big house and the position and state which the 
women realized long before the men did that he not only 
aimed at but was going to attain. Or maybe women are even* 
less complex than that and to them any wedding is better 
than no weddirg and a big wedding with a villain preferable 
to a small one with a saint. 

“So the aunt even used EUoi’s tears; and Sutpeo, who 
pocotaWy knew about what was going to happen, becmniog 



as the time drew near graver and graver. Not concerned: 
just watchful, like he must have been from the day when he 
turned his back upon all that he knew — the facss and the 
customs — and (he was just fourteen then, he told your grand- 
father) set out into a ■world which even in theory he knew 
nothing about, and 'with a fixed goal in his mind which, 
most men do not set up until the blood begins to slow at 
thirty or more and then only because the image represents 
peace and indolence or at least a crowning of vanity. Even 
then he had that same alertness which he had to wear later 
day and night -without changing or laying aside, like the 
clothing which he had to sleep in as well as live in, and in a 
country and among a people whose very language he had to 
learn — that unsleeping care which must have known that it 
could permit itself but one mistake; that alertness for measur- 
ing and weighing event against eventuality, circumstance 
against human nature, his own fallible judgment and mortal 
clay against not only human but natural foras, choosing and 
discardmg, compromising -with his dream and his ambition 
like you must -with the horse which you take across country, 
over timber, which you control only through your abihty to 
keep the animal from realizing that actually you cannot, that 
actually it is the stronger. 

“His was the curious position now. Kfe was the solitary 
one. Not EHen. She not only had the aunt to support her, but 
the fact that women never plead nor claim loneliness until 
impenetrable and insurmountable circumstance forces them 
to give up all hope of attaining the particular bauble which 
at the moment they happen to want. And not Mr Coldfield. 
Hie had not only public opinion but his own disinclinatioa 
for the big wed^g to support it without inexjugruity or 
paradox. Then (the tears won; Ellen and the aunt -wrote out 
a hundred invitations— Sutpen hrou^t in one of the wild 

S3 



i3i^oes who carried them from door to door by hand— and 
even sent out a dozen more penonal ones for the dress re- 
hearsal) when they reached die church for die rehearsal on 
die night before die wedding and found die church itself 
empty and a handfril of men from die town’s purlieus (in- 
duding two of old Ikhemotubbe’s Chickasaws) standing in 
die shadows outside the door, the tears came down again. 
Bilen went through die rehearsal, but afterward die aunt 
took her home in a state very near hysteria, though by the 
nest day it had become just quiet intermittent weeping 
^ain. There was some talk even of putting the wedding off 
I dont know who it came from, perhaps from Sutpen. But 
I know who vetoed it. It was as though die aunt were now 
bent, no longer on merely thrusting Sulpen down the town’s 
dircrat, but thrusting the wedding itself She spent all the 
next day going from house to house, the invitation hst in 
her hand, in a house dress and a shawl and one of the Cold- 
fidd negroes (they were both women) following her, per- 
haps for protection, perhaps just sucked along like a Ic^ in 
the wake of that grim virago fury of female affront; yes, she 
came to our house too, though your grandfather had never 
intended anythii^ else but to attend the wedding: the aunt 
must have had no doubts about father since father had helped 
take Sutpen out of jail, though die was probably past all 
ratiodnatiott by then- Father and your grandmother were 
just married then and mother was a stranger in Jefierson and 
I dont know what she thought except that she would never 
talk about what happened: about the mad woman whom 
die had never seen before, who came bursting into the house, 
not to invite her to a wedding but to dare her not to come, 
and then rudied out again. Mother could not evaa tell what 
wedding she meant at first, and when frther came home he 
&amp;ond mother m hysterics too, and even twenty years lata: 



mother could not tell what actually happened. There 
nothing comic in it to her. Father used to tease her about it, 
but even twenty years after that day, when he would tease 
her I have seen her begin to raise her hand (perhaps with the 
thimble on one finger) as though to protect herself and the 
same look come into her face diat must have been there when 
Ellen’s aunt departed. 

“The aunt covered the town that morning. It did not take 
her long and it was complete; by nightfall the circumstances 
of the situation had spread not only beyond the town but be- 
neath it, penetrating the hvery stable and the drovers’ tavern 
which was to supply the guests who did attend it- Ellen of 
course was not aware of this, anymore than the aunt herself 
was, or would have believed what was going to happen evoi 
if she had been clairvoyant and could actually have seen the 
rehearsal of events before time produced them. Not that 
the aunt would have considered herself insulated against bo- 
ing thus affronted, she simply could not have believed that 
her intentions and actions of the day could have any result 
other than the one for which she had surrenderesl for the 
time not only all Coldfield d%nity but all female modesty as 
well. Sutpen I suppose coxild have told her, but doubtless he 
knew that the aunt would not have believed him. Probably 
he did not even try; he just did the only thiixg he could do, 
which was to send out to Sutpen’s Hundred and bring in sis 
or seven more of his n^oes, men on whom he could de- 
pend, the only men on whom he could depend, and arm 
them with the lighted pine knots which they were holding 
at the door when the carriage came up and the wedding 
party got out. And this is where the tears stopped, because 
now the street before the church was lined with carriages and 
buggfes, though only Sutpen and possibly Mr Coldfeeld re- 
marked. that instead of hdng drawn up before the door and 

55 



empty, tliey wore lialted across the sfxeet and sdU occupied, 
and that now the banquette before the church door was a sort 
of arau lighted by the smoking torches which the negroes 
hdd above ihdr heads, the light of which wavered and 
gleamed upon the two lines of faces between which the party 
would have to pass to alter the church. There were no cat- 
calls yet, no j«ring; evidently neither Ellen nor the aunt 
suspected that anything was wroi^. 

“For a time Ellen walked out of the weqiing, the tears, 
and so into the church. It was empty yet save for your grand- 
fether and grandmother and perhaps a half dozen more who 
might have come out of loyalty to the Goldfields or perhaps 
to be dose and so miss nothing of that which the town, as 
represented by the waiting carriages, seemed to have antic- 
ipated as well as Sutpeu did. It was stfll empty even after 
the ceremony started and conduded. EHen had something of 
pride too, or at least that vanity which at times can assume 
the office of pride and fortitude; besides, nothing had hap- 
pened yet. The crowd outside was quiet yet, perhaps out of 
respect for the church, out of that aptitude and eagerness of 
the An^o-Saxon for complete mystical acceptance of im- 
molated stidcs and stones. She seems to have walked out of 
the church and so into it without any warning whatever. 
Perhaps she was stiE moving baieath that pride which would 
not allow die people inside the church to see her weep. She 
just walked into it^ probably hurrying toward the sedusion 
of the carriage where she could weep; perhaps her first inti- 
matiott was the voke diouting, ‘Look out! Dont hit her 
nowl’ and then the object — cfe, filth, whatever it was — 
pacing ha:, car perhaps the ch anging %ht itself as she turned 
and saw coie of the negroes, his torch raised and in the art of 
^rh^jng toward the crowd, the faces, when Sutpen ^ke 
&lt;0 him m that tongue which even now a good part of the 



county did not know was a civilized language. Tliat was 
what she saw, what the others saw from the halted carriages 
across the street — ^the bride shrinking into the shelter of his 
arm as he drew her behind him and he standing there, not 
moving even after another object (they threw nothing whidh 
could actually injure: it was only clods of dirt and vegetable 
refuse) struck the hat from his head, and a third struck him 
full in the chest — standing there motionless, with an expres- 
sion almost of smiling where his teeth showed through the 
beard, holding his wild negroes with that one word (there 
were doubtless pistols in the crowd; certainly knives: the ne- 
gro would not have lived ten seconds if he had sprung)while 
about the wedding party the circle of faces with open mouths 
and torch-reflecting eyes seemed to advance and waver and 
shift and vanish in the smoky glare of the burning pine. He 
retreated to the carriage, shielding the two women with his 
body, ordering the negroes to follow with another word. 
But they threw nothing else. Apparendy it was that first

the vigilance committee followed him to Mr Coldfidd’s 
gate that day two months befiare. Because the men who had 
composed the mob, the traders and drovers and teamsters,

had emerged for this one occasion like rats; scattered, de- 
parted about the country — feces which even Ellen was not 
to remember, seen for the night or the meal or just tite drink 
at other taverns twenty and fifty and a hundred miles fiirther 
on aloB^ nameless roads and then gone from there too, and

If he threw Miss Rosa over, I wouldn’t think she 
would want to tell anybody about it Quentin said. 

Ah Mr Compson said again After Mr Coldfield died in ’64, 
Miss Rosa moved out to Sutpen’s Hundred to Hve with 
Judith. She was twenty then, £om years younger than her 
niece whom, in obedience to her sister’s dying request, she 
set out to save from the family’s doom which Sutpen seemed 
bent on accomplishing, apparently by the process of marry- 
ing him. She (Miss Rosa) was bom in 1845, with her sister 
already seven years married and the mother of two duldren 
and Miss Rosa bom into her parents’ middleage (her mother 
must have been at least forty and she died in that childbed 
and Miss Rosa never forgave her frther for it) and at a time 
whm— granted that Miss Rosa merely mirrored her parents’ 
attitude toward the son-in-law— the family wanted only 
peace and quiet and probably did not ejspect and maybe did 
not even want another &lt;hild. But she was bom, at the price 
of her mother’s life and was never to be permitted to forget 
it. She was raised by the same spinster aunt who tried to ft&gt;rce 
not only the elder sister’s bridegroom but the wedding too 
down the throat of a town which did not want it, growing 
up in that dosed masonry of females to see in the fact of her 
own breithing not only ^e lone justification for the sacrifice 
of her mother’s life, not only a living and walking reproach 
to her father, but a breathing indictment, ubiquitous and 

59 



even transferable, of the entire male principle (that principle 
which had left the aunt a virgin at thirty-five). So for the 
first sixteen years of her life she lived in that grim tight litde 
house with the father whom she hated without knowing it 
— ^that queer silent man whose only companion and fiiend 
seems to have been his conscience and the only thing he 
mred about his reputation for probity among his fellow men 
— ^that man who was later to nail himself in his attic and 
starve to death rather than look upon his native land in the 
throes of repellmg an invading army — and dhe aunt who 
even ten years later was still taking revenge for the fiasco of 
Ellen’s wedding by striking at the town, the human race, 
through any arid all of its creatures — ^brother nieces nephew- 
in-law hersdf and all— -with the blind irrational fury of a 
shedding snake. The aunt had taught Miss Rosa to look upon 
her sister as a woman who had vanished, not only out of the 
family and the house but out of life too, into an edifice like 
Bluebeard’s and there transmogrified into a mask lookir^ 
back with passive and hopeless grief upon the irrevocable 
world, held there not in durance but in a kind of jeering sus- 
pension by a man who had entered hers and her family’s life 
before she was bom with the abruptness of a tornado, done 
irrevocable and incalculable damage, and gone on. In a grim 
mausoleum air of Puritan righteousness and outn^ed female 
vindictiveness Miss Rosa’s childhood was passed, that aged 
and ancient and timeless absence of youth which consisted of 
a Cassandralike listening beyond closed doors, of lurking in 
dim halls filled with that presbyterian effluvium of lugubri- 
ous and vindictive anticipation, while she writed for the in- 
fency and childhood with which nature had ottifounded and 
betrayed her to overtake the disapprobation i^^rdi^ any 
,and every thing which could penetrate tie walls of that 
house through the agency of any man, particularly herfetier. 



wliidb the aunt seems to have invested her with at birth along 
vrith the swaddling clothes. 

Perhaps she saw in her father’s death, in the resulting neces- 
sity upon her as an orphan and a pauper, to turn to her next 
of kin for food and shelter and protection — ^and this kin the 
niece whom she had been asked to save— perhaps in this she 
saw fate itself supplying her with the opportunity to observe 
ter sister’s dying request. Perhaps she even saw henelf as an 
instrument of retribution: if not in herself an active instru- 
ment strong enough to cope with him, at least as a kind of 
passive symbol of inescapable reminding to rise bloodless and 
wifiLOUt dimension from the sacrificial stone of the marriage- 
bed. Because until he came back from Virginia in ’66 and 
•found her living there -with Judith and Clytie — (Yes, Clytie 
•was his daughter too: Clytemnestra. He named her himself 
He named them all himself: all his o-wn get and all the get of 
his ■wild niggers afrer the country b^an to assimilate dKm. 
Miss Rosa didn’t tell you that two of the niggers in the 
■wagon that day were women? 

No, sir, Quentin said. 

Yes. Two of them. And brought here neither by chance 
nor oversight. He saw to that, who had doubtless seen even 
further ahead than the two years it actually took him to build 
bis house and show his good intentions to his neighbors un- 
til they allowed him to mix his -wild stock 'with their tame, 
since the difference in tongue between his niggers and theirs 
could have been a barrier only for a matter of weeks or per- 
haps even days. He brought the two women deliberately; he 
probably chcMC them with the same care and shrewdness ■with 
which he chose the other livestock— the horses and mules 
and cattle — which he bought later on. And he lived out 
there for almost five years before he had speaking acquaint- 
ance ■with any white woman in the county, just as he had no 

6x 



fimiiture in his house and for the same reason: he had at the 
time nothing to exchange for them. Yes. He named Clyde 
as he named them all, the one before Clyde and Henry and 
Judith even, with that same robust and sardonic temerity, 
naming with his own mouth his own ironic fecundity of 
dragon’s teetL Only I have always hked to beheve that he 
intended to name Clyde, Cassandra, prompted by some pure 
dramadc economy not only to beget but to designate the 
presiding augur of his own disaster, and that he just got the 
name wrong through a mistake natural in a man who must 
have almost taught himself to read) — When he returned 
home in ’66, Miss Rosa had not seen him a hundred times in 
her whole life. And what she saw then was just that ogre- 
face of her childhood seen once and then repeated at intervals 
and on occasions which she could neither count nor recall, 
like the mask in Greek tragedy, interchangeable not only 
from scene to scene, but from actor to actor and behind 
which the events and occasions took place without chro- 
nology or sequence, leaving her actually incapable of saying 
how many separate times she had seen liim for the reason 
that, waking or sleeping, the aunt had taught her to see noth- 
ing else. On those guarded and li^ubrious and even formal 
occasions when she and the aunt went out to Sutpen’s Hun- 
dred to spend the day and the aunt would order her to go 
and play -with her nephew and niec« exactly as she might 
have ordered her to play a piece for company on the piano, 
she would not see hnn even at the diimer table because the 
aunt would have arranged the visit to coincide with his ab- 
sence; and probably Miss Rosa would have tried to avoid 
meeting him even i£ he had been there. And on the four or 
five occasions during the year when EUen would bring the 
children in to spend the ^y at her father’s, the aunt (that 
strong vindictive consistent woman who seena to have been 



twice the man Aat Mr Col&lt;!fieI&lt;J was and who in very truth 
was not only Miss Rosa s mother but her fadier too) cast over 
these visits also that same atmosphere of grim embattled con- 
spiracy and alliance against the two adversaries, one of whom 
— Mr Coldfield — ^whether he could have held his own or 
not, had long since drawn in his picquets and dismanded his 
artillery and retired into the impregnable citadel of his pas- 
sive rectitude: and the other — Sutpen— who probably could 
have engaged and even routed them but who did not evax 
know that he was an embatded foe. Because he would not 
even come to the house to the noon meal. His reason may 
have been because of some delicacy for his father-in-law. 
The true reason for and beginning of the relationship be- 
tween Mr Coldfield and himself neither aunt, Ellen, or Miss 
Rosa ever knew, and Sutpen was to divulge to but one man 
— and that under the pledge of confidence as long as Mr 
Coldfield livedr— out of regard for Mr Coldfield’s carefully 
nurtured name for immaculate morality — ^and which, your 
grandfather said, Mr Coldfield himself never divulged for 
the same reason. Or perhaps the reason was that now since 
he had got out of his fether-in-Iaw all that Mr Coldfield pos- 
sessed that Sutpen could have used or wanted, he had neither 
the courage to fice his fether-in-kw nor the grace and de- 
cency to complete the ceremonial family group even four 
times a year. Or perhaps it was the reason which Sutpen gave 
himself and which the aunt refused to believe because of 
that very fact: that he did not get to town every day and 
when he did he preferred to spaid it ^e used the bar now) 
with the men who gathered each noon at the Holston House. 

That was the fece which, when Miss Rosa saw it at all, was 
across his own dining table — the face of a foe who did not 
even know that it was embattled. She was ten now and fi&gt;l- 
lowmg the aunt’s dereliction (Miss Rosa now kept her B.- 

6i 



ther’s house as the auat had done, until the n%ht the aunt 
climbed out the window and vanished) there w’as not only 
no one to make her try to play with her nephew and niece 
on diose days formal and funereal, she did not even have to 
go out there and breathe the same air which he breathed and 
where, even thot^h absent, he stdl remained, lurked, in 
what seemed to her sardonic and watchful triumph. She 
went out to Sutpen’s Hundred just once a year now when, 
in their Sunday clothes she and her father drove the twelve 
miles in a stout battered buggy behind the stout scrubby 
team, to spend the day. It was now Mr Coldfield who in- 
sisted on the visits, who had never gone out with them while 
the aunt was there, perhaps from a sense of duty, which was 
the reason he gave and which in this case even the aunt 
would have believed, perhaps because it was not the true 
one, since doubd«s even Ivdiss Rosa would not have believed 
die true one: which was that Mr Coldfield wanted to s% his 
grandchildren regarding whom he was in a steadily increas- 
ing unease of that day when their father would tell the son 
at least of that old busiaess between them which Mr Cold- 
field was not yet sure that his son-in-law had never told. 
Though the aunt was gone, she stOl managed to bequeath 
and invoke upon each of these eacpeditions something of the 
old flavor of grim sortie, more than ever now against a foe 
who did not know that he was at war. Because now that the 
aunt was gone, Ellen had reneged from that triumvirate of 
which Miss Rosa tried without realizing it to make two. 
Now she was completely alone, facing him aaoss die dinner 
table, without support even firom Ellen (at this time Ellen 
went through a complete metamorphosis, emerging into her 
next lustrum with die finality of actual re-Hrth); — fodng 
acroK the table the foe who was not even aware that he sat 
there not as hc»t and brother-in-law but as the second party 



to an annistice. He probably did not evoi look at her twice 
as weighed against his own &amp;nily and children — the small 
shght child whose feet, even when she would be grown, 
would never quite reach the floor even from her own chairs 
— ^as against who, though smaU-boned also, was what 

is known as fiiflbodied (and who would have been, if her 
life had not declmed into a time when even men found little 
enough to eat and the end of her days had been without 
trouble, fullbodied indeed. Not fat: just rounded and com- 
plete, the hair white, the eyes still even young, even a faint 
bloom yet on what would be dewlaps and not cheeks any 
longer, the small plump ringed unscarifled hands folded in 
tranquil anticipation of the food, on the damask before the 
Havtland beneath the candelabra) and against Judith already 
taller than Ellen, and Henry though not as tall fe&gt;r sixteen as 
Judith was for fourteen, yet giving promise of someday stand- 
ing eye to eye with his fether; this fece which rarely spoke 
during the meal, with eyes like (as you mi^ put it) pieces 
of coal pressed into soft dough and prim hair of that pomhar 
mouse-like shade of hair on which the sun does not ofem 
^line, against Judith’s and Henry’s out-of doors feces: Judith 
with her mother’s hair and her fether’s eyes and Henry with 
his hair halfway between his fether’s red and Ellen’s black 
and eyes of a bright dadk hazel — ^this small body of Miss 
Rosa’s with its air of curious and paradoxical awkwardness 
like a costume borrowed at the last moment and of necesaty 
for a masquraade which he did not want to attend: that aura 
of a creature doistered now by ddiberafe choice and still in 
the throes of enforced apprenticeship to, rather than volun- 
tary or even acqui^cent partidpation in, breathing— this 
bound maidservant to flch and blood waiting even now t© 
escape it by writing a sthoqlgirrs poetry about the dso-dea4

across die tabic ■with still and curious and profound intensity 
as though she actually had some intunation gained from that 
rapport ■with the fluid cradle of events (time) which she had 
acqmred or culdvatcd by listening beyond closed doors not 
to what she heard there, but by becoming supine and recep- 
tive, incapable of either discrimination or opinion or incre- 
dulity, listaiing to the prefever’s temperature of disaster, 
which makes soothsayers and sometimes makes them right, 
and of the fiiture catastrophe in which the ogre-face of her 
childhood would apparendy vanish so completely that she 
would agree to marry the late owner of it 
That may have been the last time she saw him. Because 
they quit going out there. Mr Coldfield quit There had 
never been any day set for the visit One morning he would 
merely appear at breakfast in the decent and heavy black 
coat in which he had been married and had worn fifty-two 
times each year since until Ellen married, and then fifty- 
three times a year after the aunt deserted them, imtil he put 
it on for good the day he climbed to the attic and nailed the 
door behind him and threw the hammer out the ■window 
and so died in it. Then after breakfast Miss Rosa would retire 
and reappear in the formidable black or bro'wn silk which 
the aunt had chosen for her years ago and which she con- 
tinued to wear on Sundays and occasions even after it was 
worn out, until the day when her father decided that the aunt 
would not return and permitted Miss Rosa to use the cloth- 
ing which the aunt had left in the house the night of her 
elopement. Then they would get into the buggy and depart, 
Mr Coldfield first docking the two n^roes for the noon 
meal which they would not have to prepare and (so the 
town bdieved) chargmg them for the crude one of left- 
overs which they would ha-ve to taL Thai one year they did 
not go. Doubdes Mr Coldfield fidkd to come to bredt&amp;st 



is the black cx&gt;at, and more days passed and still he did not, 
and that was all Perhaps he &amp;lt, now that die grandchildren 
were grown, that the draft on his conscience had bear dis- 
charged what widi Henry away at the State University at 
Oxford and Judith gone even furdier than that — ^into that 
transition stage between childhood and womanhood where 
she was even more inaccessible to the grandfather of whom 
die had seen but Hide during her life and probably cared less 
anyway — that state where, though still visible, young girls 
appear as though seen dirough glass and where even the 
voice cannot reach them; where they exist (this the hoyden 
who could — and did — outrun and outdimb, and ride and 
fight both with and beside her brother) in a pearly lambence 
without shadows and themselves partaking of it; in nebulous 
suspension held, strange and unpredictable, even their very 
shapes fluid and delicate and without substance; not in them- 
selves floatii^ and seeking but merely waiting, parasitic and 
potent and seraie, drawing to themselvs without efibrt die 
post-goiitive upon and about which to shape, flow into 
back, breast; bosom, flank, thigh. 

Now the period began which ended in the catastrophe 
which caused a reversal so complete in Miss Rosa as to per- 
mit her to agree to marry the man whom she had grown up 
to look upon as an ogre. It was not a volte-face of character: 
that did not change. Even her behavior did not change to 
any extent. Even if Charles Bon had not died, she would in 
all probability have gone out to Sutpen’s Hundred to live 
afier her father’s death sooner or later, and once she had done 
so she would have probably passed the remainder of her life 
there. But if Bon had lived and he and Judith had married 
and Hemy had renuined in the known world, she would 
have moved out there only when she was ready to, and she 
would have lived in her dead sister’s fiunily only as the aunt 

67 



which she actiially was. It was not her character that changed; 
despite the six years or so since she had actually seen him and 
certainly the four years which she had spent feeding her Bl- 
ther secretly at night while he hid from Confederate provost 
marshals in the attic. At the same time she was writing heroic 
poetry about the very men from whom her father was hid- 
ing and who would have shot him or hung him without 
trial if they had found him — ^and incidentally the ogre of her 
childhood was one of them and (he brought home with him 
a citation for valor in Lee’s own hand) a good one. The face 
which Miss Rosa carried out there to live for the rest of her 
life was the same face which had watched him across the 
dinner table and which he likewise could not have said how 
many times he had seen, nor when and where, not for the 
reason that he was unable to forget it but because he could 
probably not have remembered it enough to have described 
it ten minutes after looking away, and from behind the face 
the same woman who had been that child now watched him 
with that same grim and cold intensity. 

Although she was not to see Sutpen again fr&gt;r yean, she 
now saw her sister and niece more often than ever. Ellen was 
now at the full peak of what the aunt would have called her 
renegadery. She seemed not only to acquiesce, to be recon- 
ciled to her hfe and marriage, but to be actually proud of it.i 
She had bloomed, as if Fate were crowding the normal In- 
dian summer which should have bloomed gradually and 
faded gracefiilly through six or eight years, into three, or 
four, either for compensation for what was to come or to 
dear the books, pay the check to which Fate’s wife, Nature, 
had signed his name. Ellen was in her late thirties, plump, 
her face unblemished stilL It was as though whatever marks 
bdbg in the world had left upon it up to the time the aunt 
vanidt^ had been removed from between the skeleton and 

68 



the skm, between the sum of e^erience and the envelope 
in which it resides, by the intervening years of annealii^ 
and untroubled flesh. Her carriage, air, now was a little 
regal — ^she and Judith made firequent trips to town now, call- 
ing upon the same ladies, some of whom were now grand- 
mothers, whom the aunt had tried to force to attend the 
wedding twenty years ago, and, to the meager possibilities 
which the town offered, shopping — ^as though she had suc- 
ceeded at last in evacuating not only the puritan heritage but 
reality itself; had immolated outrageous husband and incom- 
prehensible children into shades; escaped at last into a world 
of pure illusion in which, safe from any harm, she moved, 
lived, from attitude to attitude against her background of 
chatelaine to the largest, wife to the wealthiest, mother of 
the most fortunate. When she shopped (there ware twenty 
stores in Jefferson now) die unbent without even getting out 
of the carriage, gracious and assured and talking the most 
complete nonsense, speaking her bright set meaningless 
phrases out of the part which she had wiittoi for herself, of 
the duchess peripatetic with property soups and medidncs 
among a soilless and uncompdled peasantry — a. woman who, 
if she had had the fortitu^ to bear sorrow and trouble, 
might have risen to actual stardom in the role of the matri- 
arch, arbitrating from the fireside comer of a crone the pride 
and destiny of her family, instead of turning at the last to the 
youngest member of it and asking her to protect the others. 

Often twice and sometimes three times a week the two of 
thpm came to town and into the house — die foolish unreal 
voluble preserved woipan now six years absent ftom the 
world— die woman who had quitted home and kin on a 
flood of tears and in a shadowy miasmic re^on something 
like the bitter purlieus of Styx had produced two children 
and then rose &amp;e the swamp-hatched butterfly, unimpeded 

69 



by weight of stomach and all the hea-vy organs of suffering 
and expenence, into a perennial bright vacuum of arrested 
sun — and Judith, the young girl dreaming, not living, in her 
complete detachment and imperviousness to actuality al- 
most like physical deafiiess. To them. Miss Rosa must not 
have been anything at all now: not the child who had been 
the object and victim of the vanished aunt’s vindictive un- 
flagging care and attention, and not even the woman which 
her office as housekeeper would indicate, and certainly not 
the factual aunt herself. And it would be hard to say which 
of the two, sister or niece, was the most unreal to Miss Rosa 
in turn — ^the adult who had escaped reahty into a bland region 
peopled by dolls, or the young girl who slept waking in 
some suspension so completely physical as to resemble the 
state before birth and as far removed from reahty’s other 
extreme as Ellen was ffom hers, driving up to the house 
twice and three times a week, and one time, in the summer 
when Judith was seventeen, stopping m on their way over- 
land to Memphis to buy Judith clothes; yes: a trousseau. 

That was the summer following Henry’s first year at the 
University, after he had brought Charles Bon home with 
him for Christmas and then again to spend a week or so of 
die summer vacation before Bon rode on to the River to 
take the steamboat home to New Orleans; the summer in 
which Sutpen himself went away, on business, Ellen said, 
doubtless unaware, such was her existence then, that she did 
not know where her husband had gone and not even con- 
scious that she was not curious. No one but your grandfather 
and perhaps Clyde was ever to know that Sutpen had gone 
to New Orleans too. They would enter Miss Rosa’s house, 
that dim grim f^ht little house where even yet, four years 
affer die had left the aunt still seemed to be just beyond any 
door with her hand already on die knob, and wt^h Ellm 

70 



would fill with ten or fifteen minutes of shrill uproar and 
then depart, taking with her the dreamy and voiitionless 
daughter who had not spoken one word; and Miss Rosa who 
in actual fact was the gtcl’s aunt and who by actual years 
should have been her sister ignoring the mother to follow 
the departing and inaccessible daughter with myopic and in- 
articulate yearning and not one whit of jealousy, projecting 
upon Judith all the abortive dreams and delusions of her own 
doomed and frustrated youth, offering Judith the only gift 
(it was Ellen who told this, with shrieks of amusement, more 
dian once) in her power: she offered to teach Judith how to 
keep house and plan meals and count laundry, receiving for 
die oSer the blank fathomless stare, the unhcaring “Whatj 
What did you say?” while even now Ellen was shri eking 
with astonished appreciation. Then they were gone — car- 
riage, bundles, Ellen’s peacock amusement, the niece’s im- 
penetrable dreaming. When they came to town next and 
the carriage stopped before Mr Coldfield’s house, one of the 
negresses came out and said that Miss Rosa was not at home. 

That summer she saw Henry again too. She had not seen 
him since die summer before although he had been home 
Christmas with Charles Bon, his friend firom the University, 
and she had heard about the balls and parties at Sutpen’s 
Hundred during the holidays, but she and her father had not 
gone out. And when Hauy stopped with Bon on the way 
back to sdiool the day after New Year’s to speak to his aunt, 
she actually was not at home. So she did not see him until 
the fohowiE^ summer, after a full year. She was downtown, 
shoppii^; she was standing on the street talking to your 
grandmother when he rode past. He didn’t see her; he passed 
on a new mare which, his father had ^voi him., in the coat 
and hat of a man now; your grandmothersaidhc was as tall 
as his fother and that he sat tin mare with the same swa^er 

71 



althoi^h lighter in the bone than Sutpen, as if his bones were 
capable of bearing the swagger but were still too light and 
quick to support the pomposity. Because Sutpen was acting 
^ role too. He had corrupted Ellen in more ways than one. 
He was the biggest single landowner and cotton-planter in 
the county now, attained by the same tactics with which 
he had built his house — ^the same singleminded unflagging 
effort and utter disregard of how his actions which the town 
could see might look and how the ones which the town 
could not see must appear to it. There were some among his 
fellow citizens who believed even yet that there was a nigger 
in the woodpile somewhere, ranging ffom the ones who 
believed that the plantation was just a blind to his actual dark 
avocation, through the ones who believed that he had fisund 
some way to juggle the cotton market itself and so get more 
per bale for his cotton than honest men could, to those who 
believed apparently that the wild niggers which he had 
broi^ht there had the power to actually conjure more cot- 
ton per acre from the soil than any tame ones had ever done. 
He was not hked (which he evidendy did not want, anyway) 
but feared, which seemed to amuse, if not actually please, 
him. But he was accepted; he obviously had too much 
money now to be rejected or even seriously annoyed any 
more. He accomplished this — ^got his plantation to runnii^ 
smoothly (he had an overseer now; it was the son of that 
same sheriff who had arrested him at his bride-to-be’s gate 
on the day of the betrothal) within ten years of the wedding, 
and now he acted his role too — z role of arrogant ease and 
leisure which, as the leisure and ease put flesh on him, be- 
came a litde pompous. Yes, he had corrupted Ellen to more 
than reni^adery, though, like her, he ysras unaware that his 
flowraing was a forced blooming too and that while he 
stifl playing the scene to the audience, behind him Bate, des- 

72' 



dny, retribution, irony — ^tie stage manager, call him what 
you will — was already striking the set and dragging on die 
synthetic and spurious shadows and shapes of the next one. 

— ^“There goes your grandmother said. But Miss Rosa 

had already seen Henry. She was standing there beside your 
grandmother, her head hardly reading your grandmofier’s 
shoulder, thin, in one of the dresses which the aunt had left 
in the house and which Miss Rosa had cut down to fit her- 
self, who had never been taught to sew either, just as she had 
assumed the housekeeping and offered to teach Judith to do 
fhe same, vdio had never been taught to cook nor taught to 
do anything save lister through closed doors, standing there 
with a shawl over her head like she might have been fifty 
instead of fifteen, looking after her nephew and saying, 
“why ... he’s slaved.” 

Then she stopped seeing Ellen even. That is, Ellen also 
stopped coming to the house, stopped breaking the carri^e’s 
weekly ritual of store to store where, without getting out, 
Ellen bade merchant and derk fetch out to her the cloth and 
the meager fiipperies and baubles which they carried and 
which they knew evm better than she that sIk would not 
buy but instead would merely finger and handle and dis- 
arrange and then reject, all in that flow of bri^t pettish vol- 
ubility. Not contemptuous, not even patronizing exactly, 
but with a bland and even childlike imposition upon the 
sufierance or good manners or sheer hdplcssness of the men, 
the merchants and derks; then to come to die house and fill 
it too with that meaning^ uproar of vanity, of imposable 
and fbundadonless advice about Miss Rosa and her &amp;ther 
and the house, about Miss Rosa’s dothcs and the arrange- 
ment of the furniture and how the food was prepared and 
even the hours at which it was eaten Because the time now 
apprtached (it was i860, even Mr Coldfield probably ad- 

73 



mittcd that war was unavoidable) when the destiny of Sut- 
pen’s feimly which for twenty years now had been like a 
lake welling from quiet springs into a quiet valley and 
spreading, rising almost imperceptibly and in which the four 
members of it floated in sunny suspension, felt the first sub- 
terranean movement toward tihe outlet, the gorge wliich 
would be the land’s catastrophe too, and the four peaceful 
swimmers turning suddenly to face one another, not yet 
with alarm or distrust but just alert, feeling the dark set, none 
of them yet at that point where man looks about at his com- 
panions in disaster and thinks When will I stop trying to save 
them and save only myselp and not even aware that that point 
was approaching. 

So Miss Rosa did not see any of them; she had never seen 
(and was never to sec alive) Charles Bon at all; Charles Bon 
of New Orleans, Henry’s friend who was not only some few 
years older than Henry but actually a little old to be still in 
college and certainly a little out of place in (hat one where 
he was — a small new college in the Mississippi hinterland 
and even wilderness, three hundred miles from that worldly 
and even foreign city which was his home — z young man of 
a worldly elegance and assurance beyond his years, hand- 
some, apparently wealthy and with for background the 
shadowy figure of a legal guardian rather than any parents — 
a personage who in the remote Mississippi of that time must 
have appeared almost phoenbt-like, fbllsprui^ from no 
childhood, bom of no woman and impervious to time and, 
vanished, leaving no bones nor dust anywhere — i. man with 
an ease of manner and a swaggering gallant air in comparison 
with which Sutpen’s pompous arrogance was clumsy bluff 
and Henry aett^y a hobble-de-hoy. Miss Rosa never saw 
him; this was a picture, an image. It was not what Ellen told 
her: Ellen at the absolute halcyon of her butterfly’s sumiiKx 

74 



and now wifili the added diann of gracious and graceful 
voluntary surrendering of youdi to her blood’s and sex’s 
successor, that concurrent attitude and behavior with the 
engagement’s span with which mothers who want to can 
almost make themselves the brides of their daughtcn’ wed- 
ding?. Listening to Ellen, a stranger would have almost be- 
lieved that the marriage, which subsequent events would 
indicate had not even been mentioned between the young 
people and the parents, had been actually performed. Ellen 
did not once maition love between Judith and Bon. She did 
not hint around it. Love, with reference to them was just a 
finished and perfecdy dead subject like the matter of vir- 
gbity would be after the birth of the first grandchild. She 
spoke of Bon as if he were three inanimate objects in one, 
or perhaps one inanimate object for which she and her fam- 
ily would find three concordat uses: a garment which Ju- 
dith might wear as she would a riding habit or a ball gown, 
a piece of furniture which would complement and complete 
the furnishing of her house and position, and a mentor and 
example to corrert Henry’s provincial maimers and speech 
and clothing. She seemed to have encompassed time. She 
postulated the elapsed years during which no honeymoon 
nor any change had taken place, out of which the (now) 
five faces looked with a sort of lifeless and perennial bloom 
like painted portraits hung in a vacuum, each taken at its fore- 
warned peak and smoothed of all thought and experience, 
the originals of which had Eved and died so long ago that 
their joys and griefs must now be forgotten even by the very 
boar^ on which they had strutted and postured and laughed 
and wept. This, while Miss Rosa, not listenit^, who had got 
the picture firom the first word, perhaps firom the name, 
Charles Bon; the spinster doomed for life at sixteen, sitting 
beneath this bright gEttcr of ddusion like it was one of those 

75 



colored electric beams in cabarets and she there for the first 
time in her life and the beam filled "with a substanccless glit- 
ter of tinsel motes darting suddenly upon her, halting for a 
moment then going on. She wasn’t jealous of JuditL It was 
not selfpity either, sitting there blinking steadily at her sis- 
ter, while Ellen talked, in one of those botched-over house 
dresses (the clothes, castoff sometimes but usually new, 
which Ellen gave her from time to time were always silk, 
of course) which the aunt had abandoned when she eloped 
with the horse-and-mule-trader, perhaps in the hope or even 
the firm intention of never wearing anything like them 
again. It was probably just peaceful despair and relief at final 
and complete abnegation, now that Judith was about to im- 
molate the frustration’s vicarious recompense into the living 
fairy tale. It sounded like a fairy tale when Ellen told it later 
to your grandmother, only it was a fairy tale written for and 
acted by a fashioiuble ladies’ club. But to Miss Rosa it must 
have been authentic, not only plausible but justified: hence 
the remark which sent Ellen again (she told this too, for the 
childish joke it was) into shrieks of amused and fretted as- 
tonishment “We deserve him,’’ Miss Rosa said. “Deserve? 
Him?” EHen said, probably shrieked too. “Of course we de- 
rive him — ^if you want to put it that way. I certainly hope 
and expect you to feel that the Goldfields are quali fi ed to 
reciprocate whatever particularly signal honor marriage with 
anyone might confer upon them.” 

Naturally there is no known rejoinder to this. At least as 
for as Ellen ever told. Miss Rosa did not try to make one. 
She just saw Ellen depart and then set about to make Judith 
the second only gift in her power. She possessed two now, 
^ one likewise bequeathed to her by the aunt who taught 
her both to keep house and-how to fit dothes by dimbing 
out a window one night though this second gift develop^ 

TtS 



late (you might say, rqpercussed) due to the fact that when 
the axmt kft. Miss Rosa was not yet large enough to be able 
to use the discarded clothing even by cutting the garments 
down. She set about secretly maldng garments for Judith’s 
trousseau. She got the cloth fiom her father’s store. She 
could not have got it anywhere else. Your grandmother 
told me that at that time Miss Rosa actually could not count 
money, that she knew the progression of the coins in theory 
but that apparendy she had never had the actual cash to see, 
touch, esqperiment and prove with; that on certain days of 
the week she would go down town with a basket and shop 
at certain stores which Mr Coldfield had already designated, 
with no coin nor sum of money changing Hp or hand, and 
that later in the day Mr Coldfield would trace her course 
by the debits scratched on paper or on walls and counters, 
and pay them. So she would have to get the material from 
him, though his stock which had begun as a collection of 
the crudest necessities and which apparently could not even 
f^d hims elf and his daughter from its own Reives, had not 
increased, let alone diversified. Yet this was where she had 
tx&gt; go to get the material to make those intimate young girl 
garments which were to be for her own vicarious bridal—' 
and you can ims^ine too what Miss Rosa’s notion of such 
garments would be, let alone what her notion of them would 
look like when she had finished them unassisted. Nobody 
knows how she managed to get the material from her fr- 
ther’s store. He didn’t gwe it to her. He would have felt it 
incumbent on him to supply his granddaughter with clothes 
if she were indecxjidy clad or if she were ragged or cold, but 
not to marty in. So I believe she stole it. She must have. She 
must have taken it almost from under her father’s nose (it 
was a sntall store and he was his own derk and from any 
pojnt in it he could see any other point) with that amoral 

77 



boUness, that affioky for brigandage in women, but more 
likely, or so I would like to think, by some subterfuge of 
such bald and desperate transparence concocted by inno- 
cence that its very simplicity fooled him. 

So she didn’t even see Ellen anymore. Apparently EUen 
had now served her purpose, completed the bright pointless 
noon and afternoon of the butterfly’s summer and vanished, 
perhaps not out of Jefferson, but out of her sister’s hfe any- 
way, to be seen but the one time more dying in bed in a 
darkened room in the house on which fateful mischance had 
already laid its hand to the extent of scattering the black 
foundation on which it had been erected and removing its 
two male mainstays, husband and son — the one into the risk 
and danger of battle, the other apparently into oblivion. 
Henry had just vanished. She heard of that too while she was 
spoidii^ her days (and nights; she would have to wait until 
her fethcr was asleep) sewing tediously and without skill on 
the garments which she was making for her niece’s trousseau 
and which she had to keep hidden not only from her father 
but from the two n^esses, who might have told Mr Cold- 
field — ^whipping lace out of raveled and hoarded string and 
thread and sewing it onto garments while news came of 
Lincoln’s election and of the fell of Sumpter, and she scarce 
listening, hearing and losing the knell and doom of her na- 
tive land between two tedious and clumsy stitches on a gar- 
ment which she would never wear and never remove fi&gt;r 
a man whom she was not even to see alive, Henry just van- 
ished: she heard just what the town heard — ^that on this next 
Christmas Henry and Bon came home again to spend the 
holidays, the handsome and wealthy New Orleansian whose 
o^agement to the daughter the mother had been filling ^e 
town’s ears with for six months now. They came again and 
now the town listened for the announcement of the actual 
78 



day. And then something happened. Nobody knew what: 
whether something between Henry and Bon on one hand 
and Judith on die other, or between the three young people 
on one hand and the parents on the other. But anywaj', when 
Christmas day came, Henry and Bon were gone. And Elkn 
was not visible (she seemed to have retired to the darkened 
room which she was not to quit until she died two years 
later) and nobody could have told from either Sutpen’s or 
Judith’s faces or actions or behavior, and so the tale came 
through the negroes: of how on the night before Christmas 
there had been a quarrel between, not Bon and Henry or 
Bon and Sutpen, but between the son and the father and 
that Henry had formally abjured his father and renounced 
his birthright and the roof under which he had been bom 
and that he and Bon had ridden away in the n%ht and that 
the mother was prostrate — though, the town beheved, not 
at the upset of the marriage but at the shock of reality enter- 
ing her life: this the merciful blow of the axe before the 
beast’s throat is cut. 

That’s what Miss Rosa heard. Nobody knows what she 
thor^ht. The town believed that Henry’s action was just 
the fiery nature of youth, let alone a Sutpai, and that time 
would cure it. Doubdess Sutpen’s and Judidi’s behavior to- 
ward one another and toward the town had something to do 
with this. They would be seen together in the carriage in 
town now and then as though nothing had occurred be- 
tween them at least, which certainly would not have been 
the case if the quarrd had been between Bon and the father, 
and probably not the case if the trouble had been between 
Henry and his &amp;ther because the town knew that between 
Hairy and Judith there had been a rdationship closer than 
the traditional loyalty of brother and sister even; a curious 
relationship: something of that fierce impersonal rivalry bo- 

79 



tweoi two cadets in a crack regiment who eat from the 
same dish and sleep under the same blanket and chance the 
same destruction and W’ho would risk death for one another, 
not for die other’s sake but for the sake of the unbroken front 
of the regiment itself. That’s all Miss Rosa knew. She could 
have known no more about it than the town knew because 
the ones who did know (Sutpai or Judith: not Ellen, who 
would have been told nothing in the first place and would 
have forgot, failed to assimilate, it if she had been told — 
Ellen the butterfly, from beneath whom without warning 
the very sunbuoyed air had been withdrawn, leaving her 
now with the plump hands folded on the coverlet in the 
darkened room and the eyes above them probably not even 
suffering but merely filled with baflled incomprehension) 
would not have told her anymore than they would have 
told anyone in Jefferson or anywhere else. MSss Rosa prob- 
ably went out diere, probably once and then no more. And 
she must have told Mr Coldfield tibat there was nothing 
wrong and evidendy she believed that herself since she con- 
tinued to sew on the garments for Judith’s wedding. 

She was stiE doing that when Mississippi seceded and 
when die first Corifedcrate uniforms began to appear in 
Jefferson where Colonel Sartoris and Sutpen were raising 
the regiment which departed in ’6i, with Sutpen, second in 
command, riding at Colonel Sartoris’ left hand, on the black 
stallicai named out of Scott, beneath the regimental colors 
whkh he and Sartoris had designed and whidi Sartoris’ 
womenfolks had sewed together out of sflk dresses. He had 
fill^ out physically from what he had been not only whai 
he first rode into Jefferson that Sunday in ’33, but from what 
had been when he and EDen married. He was not pordy 
yet, though he was now getting on toward fifiy-fiye. The 
the stomach, emne later. It came upon him suddmly, aE 
, 80 



at once, m the year after whatever it was hapf^ned to his 
engag^meat to Miss Rosa and she quitted his roof and le- 
tamed to town to live alone in her fadier’s house and did 
not ever speak to him again except whm she addressoi him 
that one time when they told her that he was dead. The 
flesh came upon him suddenly, as though what the negroes 
and Wash Jones, too, called the fine figure of a man had 
reached and held its peak after the foundation had given 
away and something between the shape of him that people 
knew and the uncompromising skeleton of what he actually 
was had gone fluid and, earthbound, had been snubbed up 
and restrained, balloonlikc, unstable and lifeless, by the en- 
velope which it had betrayed. 

She did not see the regiment depart tccause her fiither 
forbade her to leave the house until it was gone, refusbg to 
allow her to take part in or be present with the other women 
and girls in the ceremony of its departure, though not be- 
cause his son-in-law happened to be in it. He had never been 
an irascible man and before war was actually declared and 
Mississippi seceded, his acts and speeches of protest had bear 
not only calm but logical and quite sensible. But after the 
die was cast he seemed to change overnight, just as his daugb^ 
ter £llm changed her nature a few years before. As soon as 
troops began to appear in JeScrson he closed his store and 
kept it dosed all during the period that soldiers were being 
mobilized and drilled, and later, afier the regiment was gone, 
whenever casual troops wodd bivouac for the night in pac- 
ing, refusing to sell any goods for any price to the military 
and, so it was told, to the families not only of soldiers but of 
men or women who had supported secession and war only 
in talk, opinion. He refused to permit his sister to conae back 
home to live while ha: horse-tida: husband was in the 
army, he would not even allow Miss Rosa to look out the 

8i 



window at passing soldiers. He had closed his store perma- 
nently and was at home ail day now. He and Miss Rosa lived 
in the back of the house, with the front door locked and the 
front shutters closed and fastened. He spent die day, the 
neighbors said, behind one of the slighdy opened blinds like 
a picquet on post, armed not with a musket but with the big 
fcmily Bible in which his and his sister’s birth and his mar- 
riage and Ellen’s birth and marriage and the birth of his two 
grandchildren and of Miss Rosa, and his wife’s death (but 
not the marriage of the aunt; it was Miss Rosa who entered 
that, along with Ellen’s death, on the day when she entered 
Mr Coldfield’s own, and Charles Bon’s and even Sutpen’s) 
had been duly entered in his neat clerk’s hand, until a de- 
tachment of troops would pass: whereupon he would open 
the Bible and declaim in a harsh loud voice even above die 
sound of the tramping feet, the passages of the old violent 
vindictive mysticism which he had already marked as the 
actual picquet would have ranged his row of cartridges along 
the window sill. Then one morning he learned that his store 
had been broken into and looted, doubdess by a company 
of strange troops bivouacked on the edge of town and doubt- 
less abetted, if only vocally, by his own fellow citizens. That 
night he mounted to the attic widi his hammer and his hand- 
ful of nails and nailed the door behind him and threw the 
hammer out the window. He was not a coward. He was a 
man of uncompromising moral strergdi, coming into a new 
country with a small stock of goods and supporting five 
people out of it in comfort and security at least He did it 
by close trading, to be sure: he could not have done it save 
by close trading or dishonesty; and as your grandfether said, 
a man who, in a country such as Mississippi was then, would 
restrict dishonesty to the selling of straw hats and hame 
strings and salt meat would have been already locked up by 
S3 



liis own femily as a kleptomaniac. But he was not a coward, 
evai though his conscience may have objected, as your 
grandfather said, not so much to the idea of pouring out 
human blood and life, but at the idea of waste: of wearii^ 
out and eating up and shooting away material in any cause 
whatever. 

Now Miss Rosa’s life consisted of keeping life in herself 
and her father. Up to the night when it was looted, they had 
lived out of the store. She would go to the store after dark 
with a basket and fetch back enough food to last for a day 
or two. So the stock, not renewed for some time before 
that, was considerably reduced even before the looting; and 
soon she, who had never been taught to do anything prac- 
tical because the aunt had raised her to beheve that she was 
not only delicate but actually precious, was cookmg the food 
which as time passed became harder and harder to come by 
and poorer and poorer in quality, and hauling it up to her 
fifber at night by means of a wcU pulley and rope attached 
to the attic window. She did this for three years, feeding in 
secret’and at night and with food which in quantity was 
scarcely sufficient for one, the man whom she hated. And 
she may not have known before that she hated him and she 
may not have known it now even, nevertheless the first of 
the odes to Southern soldiers in that portfolio which when 
your grandfiither saw it in 1885 contained a thousand or 
more, was dated in the first year of her fother’s voluntary 
incarceration and dated at two odock in the morning. 

Then he died. One morning the hand did not come out 
to draw up the basket. The old nails were still in the door 
and neighbors helped her break it in with axes and they 
found hhn, who had seen his sole means of support looted by 
the dpfonders of his cause, even if he had repudiated it and 
thfmj with three days’ uneaten food beside his pallet bed as 

83 



if he had spent the three days in a mental balancing of his 
terrestrial accounts, found the result and proved it and then 
turned upon his contemporary scene of folly and outrage 
and injustice the dead and consistent impassivity of a cold 
and inflexible disapproval Now Miss Rosa was not only an 
orphan, but a pauper too. The store was just a shell, the de- 
serted buildmg vacated even by rats and containing nothing, 
not even goodwill since he had irrevocably estranged him- 
self from neighbors, town, and embattled land, all three by 
his behavior. Even the two negresses were gone now — ^whom 
he had freed as soon as he came into possession of them 
(through a debt, by the way, not purchase), writing out their 
papers of freedom which they could not read and putting 
them on a weekly wage which he held back in full against 
the discharge of their current market value — and in return 
for which they had been among the first Jefferson negroes 
to desert and follow the Yankee troops. So when he died, he 
had nothing, not only saved but kept. Doubdess the only 
pleasure which he had ever had was not in the meager spar- 
tan hoard which he had accumulated before his path crossed 
that of his future son-in-law — ^not in the money but in its 
r^resentation of a balance in whatever spiritual counting- 
house he believed would some day pay his sight drafts on 
self-denial and fortitude. And doubdess what hurt him most 
in the whole business with Sutpen was not the loss of the 
money but the fact that he had had to sacrifice the hoarding, 
die symbol of the fortitude and abnegation, to keep intact 
the spiritual solvency which he believed that he had aheady 
esta^hed and secured. It was as if he had had to pay the 
same note twice because of some trifling oversight of date 
of signature. 

So Miss Rosa was both pauper and orphan, with no kin 
above dust but Judith and the aunt who had been last heard 
o£ two years ago while tcyit^ to pass the Yankee lines to 



reach Illinois and so be near the Rock Island prison '.vhere her 
husband, who had ofiered his talents for horse- and mule- 
getting to the Confederate cavalry remoimt corps and had 
been caught at it, now was. Ellen was dead two years now — 
the butterfly, die moth caught in a gale and blown against a 
wall and clinging there beating feebly, not with any par- 
ticular stubborn dinging to life, not in particular pain since 
it was too light to have struck hard, nor even with very 
much remembrance of the bright vacuum before the gale, 
but just in bewildered and uncomprehending amazement — 
the bright trivial shell not even changed to any great extent 
despite the year of bad food, since ail of Sutpen’s negroes 
had deserted also to follow the Yankee troops away, the wild 
blood which he had brought into the country and tried to 
blend, with the tame which was already there, with 
the same care and for the same purpose whidh he bknded 
that of the stallion and that of his own- And with the same 
success: as diough his presence alone compelled that house 
to accept and retain human Hie; as thot^h houses actually 
possess a sentience, a personality and character acquired, not 
so much firom die people who breathe or have breathed in 
them inherent in the wood and brick or begotten upon the 
wood and brick by the man or men who conceived and 
built them — in this house an incontrovertible aflSrmation for 
emptiness, desertion; an insurmountable resistance to occu- 
pancy save when sanctioited and protected by the ruthless 
and the strong. Ellen had lost some fledh of course, but it was 
as the butterfly itself enters dissolution by actually dissolving; 
the area of wing and body decreasing a little, the pattern of 
the spots drawh^ a litde closer together, but with no wrinkle 
to show — the same smooth, almost girlish face on the pillow 
(though Miss Rosa now discovered that Ellen had been dye- 
ing her hair evidaitly for years), the same almost plump soft 
(though now anting^) Imnds on the coverlet, and only the 

85 



bafflement in the dark uncomprdhending eyes to indicate 
anything of present life by which to postulate approaching 
death as she asked the seventeen-year-old sister to protect 
the remaining child. (Henry up to now was just vanished, 
his birthright voluntarily repudiated; he had not yet returned 
to play his final part in his family’s doom — and this, your 
grandfather said, spared Ellen too, not that it would have 
been the crushing and crowning blow but that it would have 
been wasted on her since the chnging moth, even alive, 
would have been incapable now of feeling anymore of wind 
or violence.) So the natural thing would have been for her 
to go out and live with Judith, the natural thing for her or 
any Southern woman, gendewoman. She would not have 
needed to be asked; no one would expect her to wait to be. 
Because that’s what a Southern lady is. Not the fact that, 
penniless and with no prospect of ever being otherwise and 
knowing that all who know her know this, yet moving with 
a parasol and a private chamber pot and three trunks into 
your home and into the room where your wife uses the 
hand-embroidered linen, she not only takes command of all 
the servants who hkewise know that she will never tip them, 
because they know as well as the white folks that she will 
never have anything to tip them with, but goes into the 
kitchen and dispossesses the cook and seasons the very fix)d 
you are going to eat to suit her own palate — itis not this, not 
this that she is depending on to keep body and soul together: 
it is as though she were living on the actual blood itself, like 
a vampire, not with insatiability, certainly not with voracity, 
but with that serene and idle splendor of flowers abrogating 
to herself, because it fiUs her veins also, nourishment from the 
old blood that crossed uncharted seas and continents and 
battled wilderness hardships, and lurking circumstances and 
fatalities. 

That’s what she would have been expected to do. But she 



didn’t. Yet Judith still had those abandoned acres to draw 
from, let alone Clyde to help her, keep her company, and 
Wash Jones to feed her as Wash had fed Ellen before she 
died. But Miss Rosa didn’t go out there at once. Perhaps she 
never would have gone. iUthoi^h EUen had asked her to 
protect Judith, possibly she felt that Judith did not need pro- 
tection yet, since if even deferred love could have supplied 
her with the will to exist, aidure for this long, then that 
same love, even though deferred, must and would preserve 
Bon until the folly of men would stalemate from sheer ex- 
haustion and he would return from wherever he was and 
bring Henry with him— -Henry, victim too of the same folly 
and mischance. She must have seen Judith now and then 
and Judith probably urged her to come out to Sutpen’s Hun- 
dred to live, but I believe that this is the reason she did not 
go, even tiiough she did not know where Bon and Henry 
were and Judith apparently never thought to tell her. Be- 
cause Judith knew. She may have known for some time; 
even EUen may have known. Or perhaps Judith never told 
her mother ather. Perhaps Ellen did not know before she 
died that Henry and Bon were now privates in the company 
which their classmates at the University had organized. 'The 
fiist intimation Miss Rosa had had in four yeais that her 
nephew was stUl alive was the afternoon when Wash Jones, 
riding Sulpen’s remaining mule, stopped in front of the 
house and began to shout her name. She had seen him before 
but she did not recognize him — z gaunt garbling man ma- 
laria-riddai with pale eyes and a face that might have been 
any age between twenty-five and sixty, sitting on the saddle- 
less mule m the street before the gate, shouting “Hdlo, Hel- 
lo,” at intervals until she csune to the door; whereupon he 
lowered his voice somewhat, fiiough not much. “Air you 
Rosie Coldfieldt” he ssad.

it was still not dark enough for Quentin to start, not 
yet dark enough to suit Miss Coldfield at least, even dis- 
counting the twelve miles out there and the twelve miles 
back. Quentin knew that. He could almost see her, waiting 
in one of the dark airless rooms in the little grim house’s im- 
pregnable soKtude. She would have no light burning because 
she would be out of the house soon, and probably some men- 
tal descendant or kinsman of him or her who had told her 
once that light and moving air carried heat had also told her 
that the cost of electricity was not in the actual time the 
light burned but in the retroactive overcoming of primary 
inertia when the switch was snapped: that that was what 
showed on the meter. She would be wearing already the 
black bonnet with jet sequins; he knew that: and a shawl, 
sitting there in the augmoiting and defunctive twilight; she 
would have even now in her hand or on her lap the reticule 
with all the keys, entrance closet and cupboard, that the 
house possessed which she was about to desert for perhaps 
six houn; and a parasol, an umbrella too, he thought, think- 
ing how she would be impervious to weather and season 
since although he had not spoken a hundred words to her 
in his life before this afternoon, he did know that she had 
never before tonight quitted that house after sundown save 
01^1 Sundays and Wednesdays for prayer meeting, in the en- 
tire forty-three years probably. Yes, she would have the um- 
8 S 



brdla. Sbe would emerge with it when he calkd for hac and 
carry it invincibly into die spent suspiration of an evening 
without even dew, where even now the only alteration to- 
ward darkness was in die soft and fiiUer random of the fire- 
flies below the gallery, where he rose firom his chair as Mr 
Compson, carrying the letter, emerged firom the house, 
snapping on the porch light as he passed. “You will probably 
have to go inside to read it,” Mr Compson said. 

“Maybe I can read it here all right,” Quentin said. 

“Perhaps you are right,” Mr Compson said. “Maybe even 

the light of day, let alone this ” he indicated the single 

globe stained and bug-fouled from the long summer and 
whicht even when clean gave off but Ktde light — ^“would be 
too much for it, for them. Yes, for them: of that day and 
time, of a dead time; people too as we are, and victims too 
as we are, but victims of a diflerent drcumstance, simplo: 
and therefore, integer for integer, larger, more horoic and 
the figures therefore more heroic too, not dwarfed and in- 
volved but distinct, uncomplex who had the gift of loving 
once or dying once instead of being difiused and scattered 
creatures drawn blindly limb from limb foom a grab bag and 
assembled, author and victim too of a thousand homicides 
and a thousand copulations and divorcements. Perhaps you 
are right. Perhaps any more l%ht dban tins would be too 
much for it” But he did not give Quentin the letter at once. 

He sat again, Quentin sitting again too, and took up th«. 
dgar firom the veranda rail, the coal glowing a^m, the wis- 
taria colored smoke drifting again unwinded across Quai- 
tin’s foce as Mr Compson raised his feet once more to the 
railing, the letter in his hand and the hand looking almost as 
dark as a i^gro’s igainst his linen leg.

man who was at least an intending bigamist even if not an 
out and out blackguard, and on whose dead body four years 
later Judith was to find the photograph of the other woman 
and Ae child. So much so that he (Henry) could give his fa- 
ther the lie about a statement which he must have realized 
that his father could not and would not have made without 
foundation and proof. Yet he did it, Henry himself striking 
the blow with his own hand, even though he must have 
known that what his father told him about the woman and 
the child was true. He must have said to himself, must have 
said when he closed the library door for the last time behind 
hims elf that Christmas eve and must have repeated while he 
and Bon rode side by side through the iron dark of that 
Christmas morning, away from the house where he had 
been bom and which he would see but one time more and 
that with the fresh blood of the man who now rode beside 
him, on his hands: I will believe; I will. I will. Even if it is so, 
even if what my father told me is true and which, in spite of myself, 
I cannot keep from knowing is true, I will still believe. Because 
what else could he have hoped to find in New Orleans, if not 
the truth? But who knows why a man, though suffering, 
clings, above all the other well members, to the arm or leg 
which he knows must come off? Because he loved Bon. I can 
imagine him and Sutpen in the library that Christmas eve, 
the father and the brother, percussion and repercussion like 
a thunderclap and its echo, and as dose together; the state- 
ment and the giving of the lie, the decision instantaneous md 
irrevocable between father and friend, between (so Henry 
must have believed) th^ where honor and love lay and this 
where blood and profit ran, even though at the instant of 
giving the lie he knew that it was the tmth. That was why 
the four years, the probation. He must have known that it 
■would be vain, even then, on that Christmas eve, not to 
90 : 



speak of what he learned, saw with his own eyes in New 
Orleans. He may even have known Bon that well by then, 
who had not changed until then and so would in all prob- 
ability not chan^ later; and he (Henry) who could not say 
to his friend, I did that for love of yott; do this for love of me. He 
couldn’t say that, you see — ^this man, thi youth scarcely 
twenty, who had turned his back upon all that he knew, to 
cast his lot with the single fiiend whom, even as they rode 
away that night, he must have known, as he knew that what 
his &amp;ther had told him was true, that he was doomed and 
destined to kill. He must have known that just as he knew 
that his hope was vain, what hope and what for he could not 
have said; what hope and dream of change in Bon or in die 
situation, what dream that he could someday wake from 
and find it had been a dream, as in the injured man’s fever 
dream the dear suffering arm or leg is strong and sound and 
only the well ones sick. 

“It was Henry’s probation; Henry holding all three of 
them in that durance to which even Judidi acquiesced up to 
a certain point. She did not know what happened in die li- 
brary that night I dont think she ever suspected, until that 
afternoon four years later when she saw them again, when 
they brought Bon’s body into the house and she found in his 
coat the photograph which was not her fecc, not her child; 
he just waked the next morning and diey were gone and 
only the letter, the note, remaining, the note written by 
Henry since doubtless he refused to allow Bon to write — 
this announcement of the armistice, the probation, and Ju- 
dith acqui«cing up to that point, who would have refill 
as quiddy to obey any injunction of her father as Hairy had 
bem to (lefy him yet who did obey Henry iu this matter — 
not the male relative, dte brother, but because of that rdb- 
tbnship between them — that higle personality with two 

91 



bodies both of which had been seduced almost simultane- 
ously by a man whom at the time Judith had never even seen 
— die and Henry both knowing that she would observe the 
probation, give him (Henry) the benefit of that interval, only 
up to that mutually recognized though unstated and unde- 
fined point and both doubtless aware that when that point 
was readied she would, and with the same calm, the same 
refusal to accept or give because of any traditional weakness 
of sex, recall the armistice and face him as a foe, not requiring 
or even wishing that Bon be present to support her, doubt- 
less even refusing to allow him to intervene if he were, fight- 
ing the matter out with Henry like a man. first, before con- 
senting to revert to the woman, the loved, the bride. And 
Bon: Henry would have no more told Bon what his father 
had toU him than he would have returned to his father and 
told him that Bon denied it, since to do one he would have 
to do the other and he knew that Bon’s denial would be a lie 
and though he could have borne Bon’s lie himself, he could 
not have borne for either Judith or his father to hear it. Be- 
sides, Henry would not need to tell Bon what had happened. 

“Bon must have learned of Sutpen’s visit to New Orleans 
as soon as he (Bon) reached home that first summer. He 
must have known that Sutjxn now knew his secret— if Bon, 
until he saw Sutpen’s reaction to it, ever looked upon it as a 
cause fiar secrecy, certainly not as a valid objection to mar- 
riage with a white woman— a situation in which probably 
all his contemporaries who could afford it were likewise in- 
volved and which it would no more have occurred to him 
to mention to his bride or wife or to her femily than he 
would have told them the secrets of a firatemal organizanon. 
which he had joined before he married. In fkt, the maimo: 
in which his intended bride’s famfly reacted to the discovery 
of it was doubtless the first and last time when the Sutpei^ 

92 



family ever surprised him. He is die curious one to me. He 
came into that isolated puritan country household almost 
like Sutpen himself came into Jefferson: apparendy com- 
plete, Without background or past or childhood — n man a 
Htde older than his actual years and enclosed and surrounded 
by a sort of Scythian glitter, who seems to have seduced the 
country brother and sister without any effort or particular 
desire to do so, who caused all the pother and uproar, yet 
fiom the moment when he realized that Sutpen was going 
to prevent the marriage if he could, he (Bon) seems to have 
withdrawn into a mere spectator, passive, a little sardonic, 
and completely enigmatic. He seems to hover, shadowy, al- 
most substanceless, a litde behind and above all the other 
straightforward and logical, even though (to him) incompre- 
hensible, ultimatums and affirmations and defiances and chal- 
lenges and repudiations, with an air of sardonic and indolent 
detachment like that of a youthfid Roman consul making 
the Grand Tour of his day among the barbarian hordes 
which his grandfather conquered, benighted in a Iscawlii^ 
and childish and quite deadly mud-casde household in a mi- 
asmic and spirit-ridden forest. It was as if he found the whole 
business, not inexplicable of course, just tmnccessary; that he 
knew at once that Sutpen had found out about the mistress 
and child and he now found Sutpea’s action and Ifcncy’s re- 
action a fetish-ridden moral blunderir^ which did not de- 
serve to be called thinking, and which he contemplated with 
the detached attentiveness of a scientist watching the muscles 
in an anesthetized firog— watching, contemplating them fix»m 
behind that barrier of sophistication in comparison with 
which Henry and Sutpen were troglodytes. Not just the out- 
tide, the way he walked and talk^ and wore his clothes and 
handed Ellen into die dining room or into the carriage and 
perhaps, probably) ki^ed her hand and which 01en envied 

93 



for Henry, but the man hinaselfo-diat fatalistic and impene- 
trable imperturbability witii which he watched them while 
he waited for them to do whatever it would be that they 
would do, as if he had known all the while that the occasion 
would arise when he would have to wait and that all he 
would n^ to do would be to wait; had known that he had 
seduced Henry and Judith both too thoroughly to have any 
fear that he might not marry Judith when he wished to. Not 
that stupid shrewdness part instinct and part belief in luck, 
and part muscular habit of the senses and nerves of the gam- 
bler waiting to take what he can from what he sees, but a 
certain reserved and inflexible pessimism stripped long goi- 
erations ago of all the rubbish and claptrap of people (yes, 
Sutpen and Henry and the ColdSelds too) who have not 
quite yet emerged from barbarism, who two thousand yeara 
hence will still be throwing triumphandy off the yoke of 
Latin culture and intelligence of which they were never in 
any great permanent danger to b^in with. 

“Because he loved Judith. He would have added doubtless 
‘after his fashion’ since, as his intended fether-in-Iaw soon 
learned, this was not the first time he had played this part, 
pledged what he had pledged to Judith, let alone the first 
tune he would have gone through a ceremony to commem- 
orate it, make what distinction (he was a Catholic of sorts) 
he nught befrveen this one with a white woman and that 
odier. Because you will see the letter, not the first one he 
ever wrote to her but at least the first, the only one she ever 
showed, as your grandmother knew then: and, so we be- 
lieve now that she is dead, the only one which she kept un- 
less of course Aiiss Rosa or Clyde destroye4 the others after 
frie herself died; and this one here pr«erved not because Ju- 
dith pin; it away to keep but because she brought it herself 
and gave it to your grandmother afrer Bon’s death, possibly 

94 



on tie same day when she destroyed the others which he had 
written her (provided of course it was she herself who de- 
stroyai them) which would have been when she found in 
Bon s coat the picture of the octoroon mistress and the Utde 
boy. Because he was her fint and last sweetheart. She must 
have seen him in fact with exactly the sa me eyes that Henry 
saw him with. And it would be hard to say to which of them 
he appeared the more splendid — to the one with hope, even 
though unconscious, of making the image hers through pos- 
sesion; to the other with the knowledge of the insurmount- 
able barrier which the similarity of gender hopelessly inter- 
vened — ^this man whom Henry first saw riding perhaps 
dirough the grove at the University on one of the two horses 
which he kept there or perhaps crossing the campus on foot 
in the slighdy Frenchified doak and hat which he wore, or 
perhaps (I like to think this) presented formally to the man 
reclining in a flowered, almost fisminiaed gown, in a sunny 
window in his chambers — this man handsome elegant and 
evm catlike and too old to be where he was, too old not in 
years but in ejqperiencc, with some tangible effluvium of 
knowledge, surfeit: of actions done and satiations plumbed 
and pleasures exhausted and even forgotten. So that he must 
have appeared, not only to Henry but to the entire under- 
graduate body of that small new provindal college, as a 
source not of envy, because you only envy whom you be- 
lieve to be, but for accident, in no way superior to yourself: 
and what you believe, granted a little better luck fhan you 
have had heretofore, you will someday possess — ^not of envy 
but of despair: that sharp shocking terrible hopeless despair 
of the young which sometimes takes the form of insult to- 
ward and even physical assault upon the human subjea of 
it or, in extreme cases like Henry’s, insult toward and assault 
uptm any and all detractors of the subject, as witness Ifcnry’s 

95 



woient repudiation of his father and his birthright when 
Sutpen forbade the marriage. Yes, he loved Bon, who se- 
duced him as surely as he seduced Judith — the country boy 
bom and bred who, with the five or six others of that small 
undergraduate body composed of other planters’ sons whom 
Bon permitted to become intimate with him, who aped his 
clothing and manner and (to the extent which they were 
able) his very manner of hving, looked upon Bon as though 
he were a hero out of some adolescent Arabian Nights who 
had stumbled upon a talisman or touchstone not to invest 
him with wisdom or power or wealth, but with die ability 
and opportunity to pass from the scene of one scarce im- 
agjbable delight to the next one without interval or pause or 
satiety. And the very fact that, lounging before them in the 
outlandish and almost feminine garments of his sybaritic pri- 
vacy, he professed satiety only increased the amazement and 
the bitter and hopeless outrage. Henry was the provincial, 
the clr/wn almost, given to mstinctivc and violent action 
rather than to thinking who may have been conscious that 
his fierce provincial’s pride in his sister’s virginity was a &amp;lsc 
quantity which must mcorporate in itself an inabihty to en- 
dure in order to be precious, to exist, and so must depend 
upon its loss, absence, to have existed at all. In feet, perhaps 
this is the pure and perfect incest: the brother realizing that 
the sister's virginity must be destroyed in order to have ex- 
isted at all, taldng that virginity in the person of the brother- 
in-law, the man whom he would be if he could become, 
metamorphose into, the lover, the husband; by whom he 
would be despoiled, choose for despoiler, if he could be- 
come, metamorphose into the sister, the mistress, the bride. , 
Peihaps that is what went on, not in Henry’ s mind but in his 
souk Because he never thought. He fidt, and acted immedi- 
ately. He knew loyalty and ^ted i&lt;^ he knew pride and jeal- 



easy; He loved grieved and killed, still grieving and, I be- 
lieve, still loving Bon, die man to wliom He gave four years 
of probation, four years in tvHicH to renounce and dissolve 
die other marriage, knowing that the four years of hoping 
and waiting would be in vain. 

“Yes, it was Henry who seduced Judith: not Bon, as wit- 
ness the entire queerly pladd course of Bon s and Judith’s 
courtship— an engagement, if engagement it ever was, last- 
ing for a whole year yet comprising two holiday visits as 
her brother’s guest which Bon seems to have spent either in 
riding and hunting with Henry or as acting as an elegant and 
indolent esoteric hothouse bloom, possessing merely the 
name of a dty for origin history and past, about which Ellen 
preened and fluttered out her unvritting butterfly’s Indian 
summer; he, the living man, was usurped, you see. There 
was no time, no interval, no niche in the crowded days when 
he could have courted Judith. You can not eren imagine him 
and Judith alone together. Try to do it and the nearest you 
can come is a projection of them while the two actual people 
were doubdess separate and dbewhere — ^two shades pacing, 
serene and untroubled by flesh, in a summer garden — ^the 
s am e two seroie phantoms who seem to watch, hover, im- 
partial attentive and quiet, above and behind the inexplicable 
thunderhead of interdictions and defiances and repudiations 
out of which the rocklike Sutpen and the volatile and violent 
Hmry flashed and glared and ceased — ^Henry who up to that 
time had never even been to Memphis, who had never been 
away from home before that September when he went to 
the University with his countrified clothes and his saddle 
horse and negro groom; the six or seven of them, of an age 
and background, only in the surfiice matter of food and 
dothing and daily occupation any different fi:om the negro 
dbves who supported them — ^ihe same sweat, the only difier- 

97 



€iice being that on the one hand it went for labor in fields 
where on the other it went as the price of the spartan and 
meager pleasures which were available to them because they 
did not have to sweat in the fields: the hard violent hunting 
and riding; the same pleasures: the one, gambling for worn 
hnives and’ brass jewelry and twists of tobacco and buttons 
and garments because they happened to be easiest and quick- 
est to hand; on the other for the money and horses, the guns 
and watches, and for the same reason; the same parties: the 
identical music from identical instruments, crude fiddles and 
guitars, now in the big house with candles and silk dresses 
and champagne, now in dirt-floored cabins with smoking 
pine knots and calico and water sweetened with molasses — 
it was Henry, because at that time Bon had not even seen 
Judith, He had probably not paid enough attention to Hen- 
ryks inarticulate recounting of his brief and conventional 
background and history to have remembered that Henry 
had a sister — this indolent man too old to find even compan- 
ionship among the youths, the children, with whom he now 
Kved; this man miscast for the time and knowing it, accept- 
ing it for a reason obviously good enough to cause him to 
endure it and apparently too serious or at least too private to 
be divulged to what acquaintances he now possessed — ^this 
man who later showed die same indolence, almost uninter- 
est, the same detachment when the uproar about that en- 
gagement which, so far as Jefferson knew, never formally 
existed, which Bon himself never aSirmed or denied, arose 
and he in the background, impartial md passive as though k 
were not himself involved or he acting on behalf of some 
absent friend, but as though the person involved and inter- 
dict were someone whom he had never heard of and cared 
nothing about There does not even seem to have been any 
courtship. Apparently he paid Judith the dubious compE- 

9 ® 



mpnt of not even trying to min her, let alone masting on the 
marriage either before or after Sutpen forbade it — this, mind 
you, in a man v/ho had already acquired a name for prowess 
ymnng women while at the University, long before Sutpen 
was to find actual proof. No engagement, no courtship even: 
he and Judith saw one another three times in two years, for 
a total period of seventeen days, counting the time which 
Pllffti consumed; they parted without even saying goodbye. 
And yet, four years later, Henry had to kill Bon to keep 
them firom marrying. So it must have been Henry who se- 
duced Judith, not Bon: seduced her along wnth himself fiom 
fbar dhtance between Oxford and Sutpen’s Hundred, be- 
tween herself and the man whom she had not even seen yet, 
as though by means of that telepathy with which as children 
they seemed at times to anticipate one anothers’ actions as 
two birds leave a limb at the same instant; that rapport not 
like the conventional delusion of that between twins but 
rather such as might exist between two people who, regard- 
less of sex or age or heritage of race or tongue, had been 
marooned at birth on a desert island: the island here Sutpen’s 
Hundred; the solitude, the shadow of that ftthcr ■with whom 
not only the to'wn but thek mother’s ftmily as well had. 
merely assumed armistice rather than accepting and assimi- 
lating. 

“You see? there they are: this gkl, this young countrybred 
gkl who sc« a man for an average of one hour a day for 
twelve days during his lift: and that over a period of a year 
and a half, yet is bent on marrying h i m to the extent of 
foremg her brother to the last resort of homicide, even if not 
murder, to prevent it, and that after a period of four years 
during which she could not have been alwa^ certain that 
he was still alive; this father who had seen that man once, yet 
had reasem to make a six hundred nule journey to investigate 

99 



him and dtiher discover what he already and apparently by 
clairvoyance suspected, or at least something which served 
just as well as reason for forbidding the marriage; this 
brother in whose eyes that sister’s and daughter’s honor and 
happiness, granted that curious and unusual relationship 
which existed between them, should have been more jealous 
and precious than to the father even, yet who must champion 
the marriage to the extent of repudiating father and blood 
and home to become a follower and dependent of the re- 
jected suitor for four years before killing him apparently for 
the very identical reason which four years ago he quitted 
home to champion; and this lover who apparently without 
volition or desire ba:ame involved in an engagement which 
he seems neither to have sought nor avoided, who took his 
dismissal in the same passive and sardonic spirit, yet four 
years later was apparently so bent upon the marriage to 
which up to that time he had been completely indifferent as 
to force the brother who had championed it to kill him to 
prevent it. Yes, granted that, even to the unworldly Henry, 
let alone the more travelled father, the existence of the 
eighth part negro mistress and the sixteenth part negro son, 
granted even the morganatic ceremony — a situation which 
was as much a part of a wealthy young New Orleansian’s 
social and foshionable equipment as his dancing slippers — 
was reason enough, which is drawing honor a litde fine even 
for the shadowy paragom which are our ancestors bom in 
the South and come to man- and womanhood about eight- 
een sixty or sixty one. It’s just incredible. It just does not ex- 
plain. Or perhaps that’s it: they dont explain and we are not 
supposed to know. We have a few old mouth-to-mouth 
talcs; we exhume from old trunks and boxes and drawers 
letters without salutation or s^nature, in which men and, 
women who once lived and breathed are now merdy in- 
100 



itials or nicknames out of some now incximpreliensible 
tion wMck sound to us like Sanskrit or Chocktaw; we sec 
dimly people, tihe people in whose living blood and seed we 
ourselves lay dormant and waiting, in this shadowy attenu- 
ation of time possessing now heroic proportions, performing 
their acts of simple passion and simple violence, impervious 
to time and inexplicable — Yes, Judith, Bon, Henry, Sutpen: 
all of them. They are there, yet something is missing; they 
are like a chemical formula exhumed along with die letters 
from that forgotten chest, carefully, the paper old and faded 
and falling to pieces, (he writing faded, almost indecipher- 
able, yet meaningful, fa mili a r in shape and sense, the name 
and presence of volatile and sentient forces; you bring them 
together in the proportions called for, but nothing happens; 
you re-read, tedious and intent, poring, making sure that 
you have foi^ottai nothing, made no miscalculation; you 
bring them together ^;ain and a^ain nothing happens: just 
the words, the symbols, the shapes themselves, shadowy in- 
scrutable and serene, against that turgid background of a 
horrible and bloody mischandng of human affairs. 

“Bon and Henry came from the University to spend that 
first Christmas. Juith and Ellen and Sutpen saw fahn for the 
first time— Judith, the man whom she was to see for an 
elapsed time of twelve days, yet to remember so (hat foot 
years later (he never wrote her during that time. Henry 
would not let him; it was the probation, you see) when she 
received a letter from him saying We have waited hng enough, 
she and Clytie should begin at once to fashion a wedding 
dress and veil out of rags and scraps; Ellen, the esotadc, the 
almost baroque, the almost epicene objet d’ait which with 
childlike voracity she essayed to include in the fiimishing 
and decoration of her house; Sutpen, the man whom, after 
seeirg once and before juiy orgtgemcnt existed anywhere 

roi 



save in his -wife’s mind, he saw as a potential threat to the 
(now and at last) triumphant coronation of his old hardships 
and ambition, of which threat he was apparently sure enough 
to -warrant a six hundred mile journey to prove it — ^this in a 
man -W'ho might have challenged and shot someone whom 
he disliked or feared but who would not have made even a 
ten mile journey to investigate him. You see? You would 
almost believe that Sutpen’s trip to New Orleans -was just 
sheer chance, just a little more of the illogical machinations 
of a fatahty which had chosen that family m preference to 
any other m the county or the land exactly as a small boy 
chooses one ant-hill to pour boiling water into in preference 
to any other, not even himself kno-wing why. Bon and 
Henry stayed tw’o weeks and rode back to school, stopping 
to see Miss Rosa but she was not at home; they passed the 
long term before the summer vacation talking together and 
ridmg and reading (Bon was reading law. He would be, 
would almost have to, smcc only that could have made his 
residence bearable, regardless of wliat reason he may have 
brought with him for remaining — this, the perfect setting 
for his dilatory indolence: this digging into musty Black- 
stone and Coke where, of an undergraduate body still num- 
bered in two figures, the law school probably consisted of 
six others beside Henry and himself— yes, he corrupted 
Henry to the law also; Henry changed in midterm) while 
Henry aped his clothing and speech, caricatured rather, per- 
haps. And Bon, though he had now seen Judith, was very 
likely the same lazy and cathke man on whom Henry foisted 
now the role of his sister’s intended, as during the fall term 
Henry and his companions had foisted upon Bon the role of 
Lothario; and Ellen and Judith now dropping two and three 
times a wedk in tovm and stopping once to see Miss Rosa 
while on their -way by carriage to Memphis, -with a wagon 



prececling them to fetch hack the phm&lt;^ and an extra 
nigger on the box "with the coachman to stop every few 
miles and build a fire and re-heat the bricks on which Men’s 
and Judith’s feet rested, shopping, buying the trousseau for 
that wedding whose formal engagement existed no where 
yet save in Ellen’s mind; and Sutpen, who had seen Bon once 
and was in New Orleans investigating him when Bon next 
entered the house: who knows what he was thinking, w'hat 
waiting for, what moment, day, to go to New Orleans and 
find what he seems to have known all the while that he 
would findt There was no one £or him to tell, talk to about 
his fear and suspicion. He trusted no man nor woman, who 
had no man’s nor woman’s love, since Ellen was incapable 
of love and Judith was too much like him and he must have 
aen at a glance that Bon, even thor^h the dai^hter m%ht 
still be saved from him, had already corrupted the son. He 
had beoi too successful, you see; his was that solitude of con- 
tempt and distrust which success brings to him who gained 
it because he was strong instead of merely lucky. 

“Then June came and ihe end of the school year and 
Henry and Bon returned to Sutpen’s Hundred, Bon to spend 
a day or two before riding on to the River to take the steam- 
boat home, to New Orleans where Sutpen had already gcaie. 
He stayed but two days, yet now if ever was his chance to 
come to an understanding with Judith, perhaps even to fill 
in love with her. It was his only chance, his last chance, 
thot^h of course neither he nor Judith could have known it, 
ance Sutpen, thot^h but two weeks absent from home, had 
doubtless already found out about the octenroon mistress and 
the child. So for the first and last time Bon and Judith might 
have been said to have a fiee field — ^might have been, sinc« 
it was really EUen who had the firee field. 1 can murine her 
engineering that courtship, supplying Judith and Bon with 

103 



opportunities for trysts and pledges with a coy and unflag- 
ging ubiquity which they must have tried in vain to evade 
and escape, Judith with annoyed yet stiH serene concern. Bon 
with that sardonic and surprised distaste which seems to 
have been the ordinary manifestation of the impenetrable 
and shado-wy character. Yes, shadowy: a myth, a phantom: 
something which they engendered and created whole them- 
‘ selves; some effluvium of Sutpen blood and character, as 
though as a man he did not exist at all. 

“Yet there was the body which Miss Rosa saw, which Ju- 
didi buried in the family plot beside her mother. And this; 
the fact that even an undefined and never-spoken engage- 
ment survived, speaking well for the postulation that they 
did love one another, since during that two days mere ro- 
mance would have perished, died of sheer saccharinity and 
opportunity. Then Bon rode on to the River and took the 
boat. And now this: who knows, perhaps if Henry had gone 
with him that summer instead of waiting until the next. Bon 
would not have had to die as he did; if Henry had only gone 
then to New Orleans and found out then about the mistress 
and the child; Henry who, before it was too late, might have 
reacted to the discovery exactly as Sutpen did, as a jealous 
brother might have been expected to react, since who knows 
but what it was not the fact of the mistress and child, the pos- 
sible bigamy, to which Henry gave the lie, but to the fact 
that it was his father who told him, his father who antici- 
pated him, the father who is the natural enemy of any son 
and son-in-law of whom the mother is the ally, just as after 
die wedding the ftther will be the ally of the actual son-in- 
law who has for mortal foe the mother of his wife. But 
Bfenry did not go this time. He rode to the River with Bon 
and then returned; after a time Sutpen returned home too, 
fom where and for what purpose none were to know until 
10 + 



the ncjct Chiistmas, and that sunimer passed, the last sum- 
mer, the past summer of peace and content, with Henry, 
doubdess without deliberate intent, pleading Son’s suit 
better than Bon, than that indolent fatalist had ever bothered 
to plead it himself, and Judith listening with that serenity, 
that impenetrable tranqiallity which a year or so before had 
been the young girl’s vague and pointless and dreamy unvo- 
lition but was now already a mature woman’s — a. mature 
woman in love — ^repose. That’s when the letters came, and 
Henry reading them ah, without jealousy, with that com- 
plete abnegant transference, metamorphosis into the body 
which was to become his sister’s lover. And Sutpen saying 
nothing yet about what he had learned in New Orleans but 
just waiting, unsuspected even by Henry and Judith, waiting 
for what nobody ^ows, perhaps in the hope that when Bran 
learned, as he would be obliged to, that Sutpen had discov- 
ered his secret, he (Bon) woG^ realize that the game was up 
and not even return to school tie next year. But Bon did 
return. He and Henry met again at the University; the let- 
ters — from Henry and Bon both now— making we^y 
journeys by the hand of Henry’s groom; and Suq&gt;ai stiil 
waiting, certainly no one could say for what now, incredible 
that he should wait for Christmas, for the crisis to come to 
him — ^this man of whom it was said that he not only went 
out to meet his troubles, he sometimes went out and manu- 
fectured them. But this time he waited and it came to him: 
Christmas, and Hieruy and Bon rode again to Sutpen’s Hun- 
dred and even the town convinced now by Ellen that the 
engagement existed; that twenty-fourth of December, i860, 
and the nigger children, widi branches of misdetoeand holly 
for excuses, already lurking about the rear of the b% house 
to shout ‘Christmas gift’ at the white people, the rich chy 
Ttiftti come to court Judith, and Sutpen saying nothing even 

105 



yet, not suspected yet unless possibly by Henry who brought 
the matter to its crisis that same night, and Ellen at the abso- 
lute flood’s peak of her unreal and weighdess hfe which with 
the next dawn was to break beneath her and wash her, spent 
amazed and uncomprehendmg, into the shuttered room 
where she died two years later — the Christmas Eve, the ex- 
plosion, and none to ever know just why or Just what hap- 
pened between Henry and his father and only the cabin-to- 
cabin whispering of negroes to spread the news that Henry 
and Bon had ridden away in the dark and that Henry had 
formally abjured his home and birthright. 

“They went to New Orleans. They rode through the 
bright cold of that Christmas day, to the River and took the 
Steamboat, Henry stfll doing the leading, the bringing, as he 
always did until the very last, when for the first time during 
their entire relationship Bon led and Henry followed. Henry 
didn’t have to go. He had voluntarily made himself a pauper 
but he could We gone to his grandfather. No, he didn’t 
have to go. Bon was riding beside him, trying to find out 
from him what had happened. Bon knew of course what 
Sutpen had discovered in New Orleans, but he would need 
to know just what, just how mudb, Sutpen had told Henry, 
and Henry not telling him. Doubtless Hairy was riding the 
new mare which he probably knew he would have to sur- 
render, sacrifice too, along with all the rest of his life, inheri- 
tance, going fast now and his back rigid and irrevocably 
turned upon the house, his birthplace and all the &amp;miliar 
sceie of his childhood and youth which he had repudiated 
for the sake of that friend widi whom, despite the sacrifice 
which he had just made out of love and loyalty, he stfll could 
not be perfecdy firank. Because he knew that what Sutpen 
had told him was true. He must have known that at the very 
SDStant when he gave his father the lie. So he dared not ask 

106 



Bon to deny it; he dared not, you see. He could fece po \rertj', 
disinheritance, but he could not have borne that lie from 
Bon. Yet he went to New Orleans. He went straight there, 
to the only place, the very place, where he could not help 
but prove conclusively the very statement which, coming 
from his father, he had called a He. He went there for that 
purpose; he went there to prove it. And Bon, riding beside 
him, trying to find out what Sutpen had told him— Bon 
who for a year and a half now had been watching Henry ape 
his dothing and speech, who for a year and a half now had 
seen himself as the object of that complete and abnegant de- 
votion which only a youth, never a woman, gives to another 
youth or a man; who for esactly a year now had seen the 
sister succumb to that same spell which the brother had al- 
ready succumbed to, and this with no voHtion on the seduc- 
er’s part, without so much as the lifting of a finger, as though 
it actually were the brother who had put the speU on 
sister, seduced her to his own vicarious image which wallsed 
and breathed with Bon’s body. Yet here is the letter, sent 
four years afierwaid, written on a sheet of paper salvaged 
from a gutted hoi^ in Carolina, with stove polish fbtmd in 
some captured Yankee stores; fi&gt;ur years alter she had had 
any message from him save the messages from Efenry that 
he (Bon) was still aHve. So whether Etenry now knew about 
the other woman or nor, he would now have to know. Bon 
realized diat. I can imagine them as they rode, Henry sdH in 
the fierce repercussive flush of vindicated loyalty, and Bon, 
the wiser, the shrewder even if only from wider esperience 
and a frw more years of age, leamiig from Henry without 
Henry’s being aware of it, what Sutpen had told him. Be- 
cause Henry would have to know now. And I dont bdieve 
it was just to preserve Hcmy as an ally, for the crias of some 
future need. It vras because Bon not only loved Judith after 

107 



Ids fashion but he loved Henry too and I beEeve in a deeper 
sense than merely after his fashion. Perhaps in his fatalism he 
loved Henry the better of the two, seeing perhaps in the 
sister merely the shadow, the woman vessel with which to 
consummate the love whose actual object was the youth — 
this cerebral Don Juan who, reversing the order, had learned 
to love what he had injured; perhaps it was even more than 
Judidi or Henry either: perhaps the hfe, the existence, which 
diey represented. Because who knows what picture of peace 
he might have seen in that monotonous provincial back- 
water; what alleviation and escape for a parched traveler 
who had traveled too far at too young an age, in this granite- 
bound and simple country spring. 

“And I can imagine how Bon told Henry, broke it to him. 
I can imagine Henry in New Orleans, who had not yet even 
been in Memphis, whose entire worldly experience consisted 
of sojourns at other houses, plantations, almost interchange- 
able with his own, where he followed the same routine 
which he did at home — the same hunting and cockfighting, 
the same amateur racing of horses on crude homemade 
tracks, hones sound enough in blood and lineage yet not 
bred to ra&lt;» and perhaps not even thirty minutes out of the 
shafts of a trap or perhaps even a carriage; the same square 
dancing with identical and also interchangeable provincial 
virgins, to music exactly like that at home, the same cham- 
pagne, the best doubtless yet crudely dispensed out of the 
burlesqued pantomime el^ance of negro butlers who (and 
likewise the drinkers who gulped it down like neat whiskey 
between floway and unsubde toasts} would have treated 
lemonade the same way. I can imagine him, with iris puritan 
heritage— diat heritage peculiarly Anglo-Saxon — of &amp;etce 
proud mystidmi and that ability to be ashamed &lt;£ ignorance 
and ine!Kpadet»», in that dty fbrdgn and paradoxica!, with 
loS 



iw dijtnosphere at once fatal and languorous, at once feminine 
and steel-hard — this grim humorless yokel out of a granite 
heritage where even the houses, let alone clothing and con- 
duct, are built in the image of a jealous and sadistic Jehovah, 
put suddenly down in a place whose denizens had created 
their All-Powerful and His supporting hierarchy-chorus of 
beautiful saints and handsome angels in the image of their 
houses and personal ornaments and voluptuous lives. Yes, I 
can imagine how Bon led up to it, to the shock: the skill, the 
calculation, preparing Hfcnry’s puritan mind as he would 
have prepared a cramped and rocky field and planted it and 
raised the crop which he wanted. It would be the fact of the 
ceremony, regardless of what kind, that Henry would balk 
at: Bon knew this. It would not be die mistress or even the 
child, not even the negro mistress and even less the child be- 
cause of that fact, since Henry and Judith had grown up with 
a negro half sister of their own; not the mistress to Henry, 
certainly not the rugger mistress to a youth with Henry’s 
background, a young man grown up and living in a milieu 
where the otiher sex is separated into three sharp divisions, 
separated (two of them) by a chasm which could be crossed 
but cttie time and in but one direcdon — ^ladies, women, fe- 
males — ^the virgins whom gendemen someday married, the 
courtesans to whom they went while on sabbaticals to the 
cities, the slave girls and women upon whom that first caste 
zested and to whom in certain cases it doubdess owed the 
very fcet of its virginity— not this to Henry, young, strong- 
Hooded, victim of the hard celibacy of riding and hundrg 
to heat and make importunate the blood of a young man, 
to which he and his kind were forced to pass time away, with 
girls of his own class interdict and inaccessible and women 
of the second class just as inaccessible because of money and 
distance, and hence only the slave girls, the housemaids 

109 



oeatoi aad deased by white mistresses or perhaps girls with 
sweating bodies out of the fields themselves and the young 
man rides up and beckons the watching overseer and says 
Send me Juno or Missylena or Chlory and then rides on into 
the trees and dismounts and waits. No: it would be the cere- 
mony, a ceremony entered into, to be sure, with a negro, yet 
still a ceremony; this is what Bon doubtless thought. So I can 
imagine him, the way he did it: the way in which he took 
the innocent and negative plate of Henry’s provincial soul 
and intellect and exposed it by slow degrees to this esoteric 
milieu, building gradually toward the picture which he de- 
sired it to retain, accept. I can see him corrupting Efenry 
gradually into the purlieus of elegance, with no foreword, no 
warning, the postulation to come after the fact, expoang 
Henry slowly to the surface aspect — ^the architecture a litde 
curious, a litde femininely flamboyant and therefore to 
Hairy opuloit; sensuous, sinful; the inference of great and 
easy wealth measured by steamboat loads in place of a tedi- 
ous inching of sweating human figures across cotton fields; 
the flash and ^tter of a myriad carriage wheels, in which, 
women, enthroned and immobile and passing rapidly across 
the visdon, ^&gt;peared like painted portraits beside men in 
linen a little finer and diamonds a litde brighter and in broad- 
cloth a litde trimmer and with hats raked a litde more above 
feces a litde more darkly swaggering dian any Henry had 
ever seat befere: and the mentor, the man for whose sake he 


had repudiated not only blood and kin but food and sh^er 
and dothing too, whose dothing and walk and speech he 
had tned to ape^ along with his attitude toward women and 
bis ideas of honce and pride too, watching him with dud; 
cold and cadike imerotabk cakidation, watching the petnxe 
jesedve and becxmie fixed and dien tdOing Hdiry, ‘But diads 
noth. Iliads jtnt the base, the feundation. It can bdemg to 
HO 



anyone’; and Henry, ‘You mean, this is not itt That it is 
above this, higher than this, more select than this?’: and Bon, 
‘Yes. This is only the foundation. This belongs to anybody.’: 
a dialogue without words, speech, which would fix and then, 
remove without obliterating one line of the picture, this 
background, leaving the background, the plate prepared in- 
nocent again: the plate docile, with that puritan’s humility 
toward anythii^ which is a matter of sense rather than logk^ 
fict, the man, die stn^gling and sufibcating heart behind it 
saying I will believe! I tvill! I will! Whether it is true or not, I 
will believe! waiting for the ncct picture which the mentor, 
the corrupter, intended for it: that next picture, following 
the fixation and acc^tance of which the mentor would say 
again perhaps with words now, still watching the sober and 
thoughtful fiice but stiU secure in his knowledge and trust in 
that puritan heritage which must show disapproval instead of 
surprise or even despair and nothing at aU rather than have 
the disapprobadon construed as siuprise or despair: ‘But even 
this is not it’: and Henry, ‘You mean, it is still higher than 
this, sdll above this?’ Because he (Bon) would be talking 
now, laTtly, almost crypdcally, stroking onto the plate him- 
self now fhe picture which he wanted there; I can ima^ne 
how he did it — ^the caktdadon, the surgeon’s alertness and 
cold detachment fhe exposures brief, so brief as to be cryp- 
tic, almost staccato, fhe plate unaware of what fhe complete 
picture would show, scarce-seen yet ineradicable — a trap, a

doorway in a neighborhcxid a litde decadent, even a litde sin- 
ister, and Bon mentioning he owner’s name casually — this, 
corruption subtly anew by putting into Henry’ s mind the no- 
tion of one man of fhe world speaking to anofher, fhat Henry 
knew fhat Bon believed fhat Henry would know even fi:om

and cryptic voice widi something of secret and carious and

solving produced and revealed not comprehension to the 
mind, the intellect which weighs and discards, but striking

youth just waiting, looking, not yet asking why? or whstt? 
the gate of solid beams in place of the laedlike iron grilling 
and they passing cm. Bon kncxking at a small a^aemt door- 
way from which a swarthy man resembling a creature out of 
an old woodcut of the French Revolutiem erupts, ccmcemed, 
even a Httie aghast^ looking first at dbe day%ht and then at 
Hetuy and spealdhg te Bon in Bench wh^ Henry (hies not

understand and Son’s teeth glinting for an instant before he 
answers in French: ‘With him? An American? He is a guest; 
I would have to let him choose weapons and I decline to 
fight with axes. No, no; not chat. Just the key.’ Just the key; 
and now, the soEd gates closed behind them instead of be- 
fore, no sight or evidence above the high thick walls of the 
low city and scarce any sound of it, the labyrinthine mass of 
oleander and jasmine, lantana and mimosa walling yet again 
the strip of bare earth combed and curried with powdered 
shell, raked and immaculate and only the most recent of the 
brown stains showing now, and the voice — the mentor, the 
guide standing aside now to watch the grave provincial face 
— casually and plcasandy anecdotal: ‘The customary way is 
to stand back to back, the pistol in your right hand and the 
comer of the other cloak in your left. Then at the signal you 
begin to walk and when you feel the cloak tauten you turn 
and fire. Though there are some now and then, when the 
blood is especially hot or when it is still peasant blood, who 
prefer knives and one doak. They j&amp;ce one another inside 
the same doak, you se^, each holdir^ the other’s wrist with 
the left hand. But that was never my way’ — casual, chatty, 
you see, waiting fi&gt;r the countryman’s slow question, who 
knew already now before he asked it: ‘What would you — 
they be fighting for?’ 

“Yes, Henry would know now, or believe that he knew 
now; anymore he woidd probably consider anti-dimax 
though it would not be, it would be anything but that, the 
final blow, stroke, touch, the keen surgeonlike compounding 
which the now diocked nerves of the patient would not even 
fed, not know that the first hard shocks were the random 
and crude. Because there was that ceremony. Bon knew that 
that would be what Henry would rerist, find hard to stomach 
and retain. Oh he was shrewd, this man whom for weeks 

113 



now Henry was realizing diat he knew less and l«s, this 
stranger immersed and oblivious now in the formal, almost 
ritual, preparations for the visit, finicking almost like a wo- 
man over the fit of the new coat which he would have or- 
dered for Henry, forced Henry to accept for this occasion, by 
means of which the entire impression vdiich Henry was to 
rardve from the visit would be established before they even 
left the house, before Henry ever saw the woman: and Henry, 
the countryman, the bewildered, with the subde tide already 
setdt^ beneath him toward the point where he must dther 
betray himself and his entire upbringing and thinking, or 
deny the fidiend for whom he had already repudiated home 
and kin and all; the bewildered, the (for that time) helpless, 
who wanted to believe yet did not see how he could, being 
carried by the friend, the maitor, through one of those in- 
scrutable and curiously lifeless doorways like that before 
which he had seen the horse or the trap, and so into a place 
which to his puritan’s provincial mind all of morality was 
upside down and all of honor perished — a. place created for 
and by voluptuousness, the abasbless and unabashed senses, 
and the country boy with his simple and erstwhile untrou- 
bled code in which females were ladies or whores or slaves 
looked at the apotheosis of two doomed races presided over 
by its own victim — a woman with a face like a tragic mag^ 
nolia, the eternal female, the eternal Whosufiers; the child, 
the boy, sleeping in silk and lace to be sure yet complete 
chattel of him who, begetting him, owned him body and 
soul to sell (if he chose) like a calf or puppy or sheep; and the 
mmtor watching again, perhaps even the gambler now 
thinking Have I won or hd? as they emerged and returned to 
Bon’srooms, for that while impotent even with talk, riirewd- 
QC5S, no longer counting upon that puritan character whkh 
must show neither stnpiise nor despair, having to cotn^now

(if on anything) on the corruption itself, the love; he could 
not even say, ‘Well* What do you say about it?' He could 
only wait, and that upon the absolutely unpredictable actions 
of a man who lived by instinct and not reason, until Henry 
should speak, ‘But a bought woman. A whore’: and Bon, 
even gendy now, ‘Not whore. Dont say that. In fact, never 
refer to one of them by that name m New Orleans: other- 
wise you may be forced to purchase that privilege with some 
of your blood from probably a thousand men , and perhaps 
still gendy, perhaps now even with something of pity: that 
pessimistic and sardonic cerebral pity of the intelligent for 
any human iiyustice or folly or sufering: ‘Not whores. And 
not whores because of us, the thousand. We — ^the thousand, 
the white men — ^made them, created and produced them; we 
even made the laws which declare that one eighth of a speci- 
fied kind of blood shall outweigh seven eights of another 
kind. I admit that. But that same white race would have 
made them slaves too, laborers, cooks, maybe even fidd 
hands, if it were not for this thousand, these few men like 
myself without principles or honor either, perhaps you will 
say. We cannot, perhaps we do not even want to, save all of 
them; perhaps the thousand we save are not one in a thou- 
sand. But we save that one. God may mark every sparrow, 
but we do not pretend to be God, you see. Perhaps we do not 
even want to be God, since no man would want but one of 
these sparrows. And perhaps when God looks into one of 
these establishments like you saw tonight. He would not 
choose one of us to be God either, now that He is old. 
Though He must have been young once, surely He ’wras 
young once, and surely someone who has csdsted as long as 
He has, who has looked at as mudi crude and promiscuous 
sinning without grace or restraint or decorum as He has had 
to, to contemplate at last, evea though the instances axe not 

ns 



one in a tliousand thousand, the pdndples of honor, decorum 
and gentleness applied to perfectly normal human instinct 
whidh you Anglo-Saxons insist upon calling lust and in whose 
service you revert in sabbaticals to the primordial caverns, the 
fill firom what you call grace fogged and clouded by Heaven- 
ddfying words of extenuation and explanation, the return to 
grace heralded by Heaven-placating cries of satiated abase- 
ment and fl^ellation, in ncidier of which — ^the defiance or 
the placation — can Heaven find interest or even, after the 
first two or fhree times, diversion. So perhaps, now that God 
is an old maai, he is not interested in ^ way we serve what 
you call lust either, perhaps He does not even require of us 
that we save this one sparrow, anymore than we save the one 
yarrow which we do save for any commendation from Him. 
But we do save that one, who but for us would have been 
sold to any brute who had the price, not sold to him for the 
night like a white prostitute, but body and soul for life to 
him who could have used her with more impunity than he 
would dare to use an animal, heifex or mare, and then dis- 
card^ or sold or even murdered when worn out or vhen 
her keqp and hex price no longer balanced. Yes: a sparrow 
which ^d himself neglected to marL Because though men, 
white men, created her, God did not stop it. Hie planted the 
seed which brought her to flowar — the white blood to give 
the shape and pigment of what the white man calls female 
beauty, to a female principle which existed, queenly and 
complete,, in the hot equatorial groin of the woidd long be- 
fore that white one of ours came down from trees and lost 
fts hair and bleached out— a principle apt docile and instinct 
with strange and ancient curious pleasures of the (which 

h aQ: thexe is nothing else} which her white sisters of a mush- 
room yesterday ftee from in moral and outrs^ed horror— a 
prmd^ vdbkh, whore her white sister must needs try to

make an economic matter of it like someone who insists upon 
installing a counter or a scales or a safe in a store or business 
for a certain percent^e of the profits, reigns, wise supine and 
all-powerful, from the sunless and silken bed which is her 
throne. No: not whores. Not even courtesans — creatures 
taken at childhood, culled and chosen and raised more care- 
fully than any white girl, any nun, than any blooded mare 
even, by a person who gives them the unsleeping care and 
attention which no mother ever gives. For a price, of course^ 
but a price offered and accepted or declined through a system 
more formal than any that white girls are sold under since 
they are more valuable as commodities than white girls, 
raised and trained to fulfill a woman’s sole end and purpose: 
to love, to be beautiful, to divert; never to see a man’s face 
hardly until brought to the ball and offered to and chosen by 
some man who in return, not can and not will but must, sup- 
ply her with the surroundings proper in which to love and 
be beautiful and divert, and who must usually risk his life OT 
at least his blood for that privilege. No, not whores. Some- 
times I believe that they are the only true chaste women, not 
to say virgins, in America, and they remain true and feithful 
to that man not merely until he dies or firees them, but until 
they die. And where will you find whore or lady either 
whom you can count on to do that?’ and Henry, ‘But you 
married her. You married her’: and Bon — ^it would be a 
little quicker now, sharper now, thot^h still gentle, still 
patient^ though stOl the iron, the steel — the gambler not 
quite yet reduced to his final trump: ‘Ah. That ceremony. I 
see. That’s it, then. A formula, a shibboleth me an i ng less as a 
chil d’s game, performed by someone created by the situation 
whose need it answered: a crone mumbling in a dungeon 
lighted by a handful of burning hair, somethmg m a tongue 
which not even the girls themselves understand anymore^ 

117 



maybe not even the cxone herselfi rooted in nothing of eco- 
nomics for her or for any possible pro^ny since the very 
fact that "we acquiesced, suffered the &amp;rce, was her proof and 
assurance of that which the ceremony itself could never en- 
force; vesting no new rights in no one, denying to none the 
old— a ritual as meaningless as diat of collie boys in secret 
rooms at night, even to the same archaic and forgotten sym- 
bols? — you call that a marriage, when the night of a honey- 
moon and the casual business with a hired prostitute consists 
of the same suaerainty over a (temporarily) private room, 
the same order of removing the same clothes, the same con- 
junction in a single bed? Why not call that a marriage too?’ 
and Henry: ‘Oh I know. I know. You give me two and two 
and you tell me it makes five and it does make five. But 
there is sdll the marriage. Suppose I assume an obligation to 
a man who cannot speak my language, the obligation stated 
to him in his own and I agree to it: am 1 any the less obligated 
because I did not happen to know the tongue in which he 
accepted me m good faith? No: the more, the more.’ and 
Bon— the trump now, the voice gentle now: ‘Have you for- 
got that this woman, this child, are niggers? You, Henry Sut- 
pai of Sutpen’s Hundred in Mississippi? You, talking of mar- 
riage, a wedding, here?’ and Henry— the de^air now, the 
last bitter cry of irrevocable undefeat: ‘Yes. I know. I know 
that. But it’s still there. It’s not right. Not evai you doing it 
makes it right. Not even you.’ 

“So that was alL It should have been all; that afternoon 
four years latear ^otdd have happmed the next day, the four 
years, the interval, mere anti-climax: an attenuation and pro- 
longation of a condusion already r^ to happen, by the War 
by a stupid and bloody aberration in the h^h (and impos- 
sibk) destiny of the United States, maybe instigated by that 
family fetality which possessed, along with all drcumstance, 

Ii8 



that curious lack of economy between cause and effect which 
is always a characteristic of fate when reduced to tuing hu- 
man beings for tools, material Anyway, Henry waited four 
years, holdup the three of them in that abeyance, that dur- 
ance, waiting, hoping;, for Bon to renounce the woman and 
dissolve the marria^ which he (Henry) admitted was no 
naarriage, and which he must have known as soon as he saw 
the woman and the cMd that Bon would not renounce. In 
feet, as time passed and Henry became accustomed to the 
idea of that ceremony which was still no marriage, that may 
have been the trouble with Henry— not the two ceremonies 
but the two women; not the fert that Bon’ s intention was to 
commit bigamy but that it was apparendy to make his (Ifcn- 
ry’s) sister a sort of junior partner in a harem. Anyway, he 
waited, hoped, for four years. That spring they returned 
north, into Mississippi. Bull Run had b^ fought and there 
was a company organizing at the University, among the 
student body. Henry and Bon joined it. Probably Henry 
wrote Judith where they were and what they intended to do. 
They enlisted together, you see, Hbiry watching Bon and 
Bon permitting himself to be watched, the probation, the 
durance: the one who dared not let the other out of his sight, 
not from fear that Bon would marry Judith with Bfenry not 
diere to stop it, but that Bon would marry Judith and then 
he ^enry) would have to live £ot die rest of his life with 
the knowledge that he was glad dat he had bem so betrayed, 
with the coward’s joy of surrendering without having been 
vanquished; the odier for that same reason too, who could, 
not have wanted Judith without Henry since he must neyex 
have doubted but what he could marry Judith whan he 
widied, in spite of brother and father both, because as I said 
before, it was not Judith who was the olject of Son’s love or 
of Henry’ s solicitude. She was just the bl m k shape, dbe empty 

119 



vessel in wliich each of them strove to presave, not the il- 
lusion of himsdf nor his illusion of the otha hut what each 
conceived the otha to believe him to be — the man and the 
youth, seducer and seduced, who had known one another, 
seduced and been seduced, victiniized in turn each by the 
other, conquaa vanquished by his own strength, vanquished 
conquering by his own weakness, before Judith came into 
their joint lives even by so much as girlname. And who 
knows? thae was the War now; who knows but what the 
&amp;.tality and the fatality’s victims did not both think, hope, 
that the War would settle the matter, leave free one of the 
two itrecondlables, since it would not be the first time that 
youth has taken catastrophe as a direct act of Providence for 
the sole purpose of solving a personal problem which youth 
itself co^ not solve. 

“And Judith: how else to explain ha but this ways Surely 
Bon could not have corrupted ha to fatalism in twelve days, 
who not only had not tried to corrupt ha to unchasttty but 
not even to defy ha father. No: anything but a fatalist, who 
was the Sutpen with the ruthless Sutpen code of taking what 
it wanted provided it were strong enough, of the two &lt;iil- 
drenasHenry was the Coldfield withtl^ Coldfield cluttering 
of morality and rules of right and wrong; who while Henry 
saeamed and vomited, looked down from the loft that nigl^ 
on the spectacle of Sutpai fighting halfbaked with one of his 
halfisaked niggers with the same cold and attentive interest 
whh which Stnpen would have watched Henry fighting with 
a negro boy of his own age and weight Because she could 
not have known the reason for her fiitha’s objection to the 
marriige. Henry would not have told ha, and she would not 
have asked ha fiither. Because, evoi if she had known it^ it 
would have made no difference to ha. She would have acted 
as Sutpen would have acted with anyone who tdbd to cro^ 
lao 



him: she would have taken Bon anyway. I can imagine her 
if necessary even murdering the other woman. But she cer- 
tainly would have made no investigation and then held a 
moral debate betv/een -what she wanted and what she thought 
was right. Yet she waited. She waited four years, with no 
word from liim save through Henry that he (Bon) was alive. 
It was the probation, the durance; they all three accepted it; 
I dont beheve there was ever any promise between Henry 
and Bon demanded or offered. But Judith, -who could not 
have known what happened nor why. — Have you noticed 
how so often when we try to reconstruct the causes which 
lead up to the actions of men and women, how with a sort 
of astonishment we find ourselves now and then reduced to 
the behef, the only possible belief, that they stemmed from 
some of the old virtues? the thief who steals not for greed 
but for love, the murderer who kills not out of lust but pity? 
Judith, giving implicit trust where she had given love, giving 
implicit love where she had derived breath and pride: that 
true pride, not that false kind which transforms what it does 
not at the moment understand into scorn and outrage and so 
vents itself in pique and lacerations, but true pride which can 
say to itself without abasement I love, I will accept no suh* 
stitute; something has happened between him and my father; if my 
father was right, I will never see him again, if wrong he will come 
or send for me; if happy I can be I will, if suffer I must I can. Be- 
cause she waited; she made no effort to do anything else; her 
relations with her father had not altered one jot; to see them 
together. Bon might never have even existed — the same two 
cahn impenetrable faces seen together in the carriage in town 
during the next few months after Ellen took to her bed, be- 
tween that Christmas day and the day when Sutpen rode 
away with his and Sartoris’ regiment They didn t talk, tell 
one another anything, you see — ^Sutpen, what he had learned 



about Bon; Judith, that she knew where Bon and Henry now 
were. They did not need to talL They were too much alike. 
They were as two peopk become now and then, who seem 
to know one another so well or are so much alike that the 
power, the need, to communicate by speech atrophies from 
disuse and, comprehending without need of the medium of 
ear or intellect, they no longer understand one another’s 
actual words. So she did not tell him where Henry and Bon 
were and he did not discover it until after the University 
company departed, because Bon and Henry enrolled and 
then hid themselves somewhere. They must have; they must 
have paused in Oxford only long enough to enroE before 
riding on, because no one who knew them either in Oxford 
or in Jefierson knew that they were members of the com- 
pany at the time, which would have been almost impossible 
to conceal otherwise. Because now people — ^fathers and 
mothers and sisters and kin and sweethearts of those youi^ 
men — vrece coming to Oxford from further away than Jef- 
ferson — families with fiiod and bedding and servants, to bi- 
vouac among the femilies, the houses, of Oxford itself, to 
watch the gallant mimic marching and countermarching of 
the sons and the brothers, drawn all of them, rich and poor, 
aristocrat and redneck, by what is probably the most mov- 
ing mass-sight of aE human mass-experience, fer more so 
than the spectacle of so many virgins going to be sacrificed 
to some heathen Principle, some Priapus — ^the sight of young 
men, the %ht quick bones, the bright gallant deluded blood 
and flesh dressed in a martial glitter of brass and plumes, 
marching away to a battle. And there would be music at 
night— frddle and triangle among the blazing candles, the 
blowing of curtains in tafl windows on the Aprfl darkness, 
the swing of crinoline indiscriminate within the circle of 
plain gray cufl" of the soldier or the bandol gold c£ rank, of 
122 



an army even if not a war of gentlemen, u-here private and 
colonel called each other by their given names not as one 
farmer to another across a halted plow in a field or across a 
counter in a store laden with calico and cheese and strap oil, 
but as one man to another above the suave powrdcred should- 
ers of women, above the tw’O raised glasses of scuppemong 
claret or bought champagne — music, the nighdy repetitive 
last waltz as the days passed and the company waited to 
move, the brave trivial glitter against a black night not ca- 
tastrophic but merely background, the perennial last scented 
q&gt;ring of youth; and Judith not there and Henry the roman- 
tic not there and Bon the fatalist, hidden somewhere, the 
■w'atcher and the watched: and the recurrent flower-ladca 
dawns of that April and May and June filled with bugles, en- 
tering a hundred windows where a himdred still unbrided 
widows dreamed virgin unmeditant upon the locks of black 
or brown or yellow hair and Judith not one of these: and five 
of the company, mounted, with grooms and body servants 
in a forage wagon, in their new and unstained gray made 
a tour of the State with the flag, the company’s colors, the 
segments of silk cut and fitted but not sewn, from house to 
house until the sweedieart of each man in the company had 
taken a few stitches in it, and Henry and Bon not of these 
either, since they did not join the company until after it de- 
parted. They must have emerged from whatever place it was 
that they lurked in, emerging as though unnoticed firom the 
roadside brake or thicket, to fell in as the marching company 
passed; the two of them — ^the youth and the man, the youth 
deprived twice now of his birthright, who should have made 
one among the candles and fiddles, the kisses and the des- 
perate trars, who should have made one of the color guard 
itself which toured the State with the unsewn flag; and die 
man who should not have been there at all, who was too old 

123 



to be there at all, both in years and e3|&gt;erience: that mental 
and spiritual orphan whose fate it apparently was to exist in 
some limbo halfway between where his corporeahty was and 
his mentality and moral equipment desir^ to be — an under- 
graduate at the University, yet by the sheer accumulation of 
too fiiU years behind him forced into the extra-academic of a 
law class containing six members; in the War, by that same 
force removed into the isolation of commissioned rank. He 
received a lieutenancy before the company entered its first 
engagement even. I dont think he wanted it; 1 can even im- 
agine him trying to avoid it, rrfuse it. But there it was, he 
was, orphaned once more by the very situation to which and 
by which he was doomed — the two of them officer and man 
now but still watcher and watched, waiting for something 
but not knowing what, what act of fate, destiny, what ir- 
revocable sentence of what Judge or Arbiter betw^n them 
since nothing less would do, nothing halfway or reversible 
would seem to suffice — ^the officer, the lieutenant who pos- 
sessed the slight and authorized advantage of being able to 
say You go there, of at least sometimes remaining behind the 
platoon which he directed; the private who carried that of- 
ficer, ffiot through the shoulder, on his back while the regi- 
ment fell bade under the Yankee guns at Pittsburgh Landing, 
carried him to safety apparently for the sole purpo» of 
watdhmg him for two years more, writing Judith meanwhile 
that they were both alive, and that was aU. 

*‘And Judith. She lived alone now. Perhaps die had lived 
alone ever since that Christmas day last year and then year 
before last and then three years and then four years ago, since 
though Sutpen was gone now with his and Sartoris’ raiment 
and the negrora — ^the wild stock with which he had created 
Sutpen’s Hundred^had followed the first Yankee troops to 
pass through Jefferson, she lived in anyffi^ but soUta^ 

124, 



wBat with Ellen in bed in the shuttered room, requiri^ the 
unremitting attention of a child while she waited with diat 
amazed and passive uncomprehension to die; and she Qudith) 
and Clytie making and keeping a kitchen garden of sorts to 
keq&gt; them alive; and Wash Jones, living m the abandoned 
and rottu^ fishing camp in the river bottom which Sutpen 
had built after the first woman — ^Ellen — entered his house 
and the last deer and bear hunter went out of it, where he 
now permitted Wash and his daughter and infint grand- 
daughter to live, performing the heavy garden work and 
supplying EUen and Judith and then Judith with fish and 
game now and then, even entering die house now, who 
until Sutpen went away, had never approached nearer than 
the scuppemong arbor behind the kitchen where on Sun- 
day afiemoons he and Sutpen would drink from the demi- 
john and the bucket of spring water which Wadi fetched 
firom almost a mile away, Sutpen m the barrel stave ham- 
mock talking and Wash squatting against a post, chortling 
and guffawing. It was not solitude and certainly not idle- 
ness for Judith: the same impenetrable and serene foce, only 
a litde older now, a litde thinner now, which had appeared 
in town in the canine beside her father’s within a week after 
it was learned that hst fiance and her brother had quitted the 
house in the night and vanished. When she came to town 
now, in the made-over dress which all Southern women 
now wore, in the carriage still but drawn now by a mule, a 
plow mule, soon the plow mule, and no coachman to drive 
it mther, to put the mule in the harness and take it out; to 
join the other women — ^there were ■tyounded injefferson then 
— ^in the improvised hospital where (the nurtured virgin, the 
supremely and traditiomlly idle) they cleaned and dx^sed 
the sdffouled bodies of strange injured and dead and made 
lint of the window curtains and sheets and Hnen of the 

12 $ 



houses in whidi they had been bom; there were none to ask 
her about brother and sweetheart, while they talked among 
themselves of som and brothers and husbanch with teara and 
grief perhaps, but at least with certainty, knowledge. Judith 
waiting too, like Henry and Bon, not knowing for wh^ but 
unlike Henry and Bon, not even knowing for why. Then 
Bllen died, the butterfly of a forgotten summer two years de- 
funcdve now — ^tbc substanceless shell, the shade impervious 
to any alteration of dissolution because of its very weight- 
lessness: no body to be buried: just the shape, the recollec- 
lion, translated on some peaceful afternoon without bdl or 
catafalque into that cedar grove, to He in powder — light 
paradox beneath the thousand pounds of marble monument 
which Sutpcn (Colonel Sutpen now, since Sartoris had been 
deposed at the annual election of regimental oflScers the year 
before) broughtin the regimentalforagewagonfromCharl»- 
ton. South Carolina and set above the faint grassy depression 
which Judith told him was Ellen’s grave. And then her grand- 
ftther died, starved to death nailed up in his own atdc, and 
Judith doubtless inviting Miss Rosa to come out to Sutpen’s 
Hundred to Hve and Miss Rosa declining, waiting, too, ap- 
parently upon this letter, this first direct word from Bon in 
ft&gt;ur years and which, a week after she buried bim, too, beside 
her mother’s tombstone, she brought to town herself in the 
surrey drawn by the mule which both flie and Clytie had 
learned to catch and harness, and gave to your grandmother, 
bringing the letter voluntarily to your grandmother, who 
Qudith) never called on anyone now, had no fiiends now, 
doubtless knowing no more why she chose your grandmother 
to give the letter to than your grandmother knew; not thin 
now but gaunt, the Sutpen skuH showing indeednow through 
the worn, the Coldfield, flesh, the hce which had long since 
forgotten how to be young and yet absolutely impenetrable, 
lad 



absolutely serene: no mourning, not even griefj and your 
grandmother saying, ‘Me’ You want me to keep it?’ 

“‘Yes,’ Judith said. ‘Or destroy it. As you like. Read it if 
you like or dont read it if you like. Because you make so 
little impression, you see. You get bom and you tty this and 
you dont know why only you keep on trying it and you are 
horn at the same tune with a lot of other people, aU tw'vpd 
up with them, like trying to, having to, move your arms and 
legs with strings only the same strings are hitched to all tl^ 
other arms and legs and the others all trying and they dont 
know why either except that the strings are all in one an- 
other’s way like five or six people all trying to make a rug 
on the same loom only each one wants to weave his own 
pattern into the rug; and it cant matter, you know that, or 
the Ones that set up the loom would have arranged things a 
little better, and yet it must nutter because you keep on try- 
ing or havir^ to keep on trying and then all of a sudden it’s 
all over and all you have left is a block of stone with scratches 
on it provided there was someone to remember to have the 
marble scratched and set up or had time to, and it rains on it 
and the sun shines on it and after a while they dont even re- 
member the name and what the scratches were trying to tdl, 
and it doesn’t matter. And so maybe if you could go to some- 
one, the stranger the better, and give them something — at. 
scrap of paper — something, anything, it not to mean any- 
thing in itself and them not even to read it or keep it, not 
even bother to throw it away or destroy it, at least it would 
be something just because it would have happened, be re- 
membered even if only from passing from one hand to an- 
other, one mind to another, and it would be at least a scratch, 
something, somethii^ that might make a madk on something 
that was once for the reason diat it can die someday, while 
the block of 5tone cant be is because it never can become was

because it cant ever die or perisb . . . ’ and your grandmotier 
watching her, the impenetrable, the aim, the absolutely se- 
raae face, and crying: 

‘“Nol No! Not that! Think of your ’ and the faor 

watching her, comprehending, still serene, not even bitter: 

“‘Oh. I? No, not that. Because somebody will have to 
take care of Clyde, and father, too, soon, who will want 
somethii^ to eat after he com« home because it wont last 
much longer since they have begun to shoot one another 
now. No. Not that Women dont do diat for love. I dont 
even believe that men do. And not now, anyway. Because 
there wouldn’t be any room now, for them to go to, 
wherever it is, if it is. It would be foil already. Glutted. Like 
a theater, an opera house, if what you expect to find is for- 
getting, diversion, aitertainment; like a bed already too fidl 
if what you want to find is a chance to lie still and sleep and 
sleep and sleep* — 

Mr Compson moved. Half rising, Quentin took the letter 
firom him and beneadi the dim bug-fouled globe opened it, 
carefully, as though the sheet, the desiccated square, were 
not the paper but the intact ash of its forrn^ shape and sub- 
stance: and meanwhile Mr Compson’s voia speaking on 
while Quentin heard it without listening: “Now you can see 
why 1 said that he loved her. Because there were other letters, 
many of them, gallant flowery indolent firequent and insin- 
cere, sent by hand over that forty miles between Oxford and 
Jefferson after that first Christmas — ^the metropolitan gallant’s 
idle and delicately flattoing (and doubtless to him, meaning- 
less} gesture to the bucolk maiden-^and that bucolic maiden, 
with that profound and absolutely ine;^licable tranquil pa- 
tient clairvoyance ofwomen against whkh that metropolitan 
gallant’s foppish posturing was just the jackanape antics of a 
small boy, receiving the letters without understanding them,

not even keeping them, for all tlieir elegant and gallant and 
tediously contrived turns of form and metaphor, until the 
next one arrived. But keeping this one wMch must have 
reached her out of a dear sky after an interval of foiu: years, 
considering this one worthy to give to a stranger to keep or 
not to keep, even to read or not to read as the stranger saw 
fit, to make that scratch, tihat undying mark on the blank 
face of the oblivion to whidh we are dl doomed, of which 

die q)oke Quentin hearing without having to listen as 

he read the feint spidery script not like something impressed 
upon the paper by a once-living hand but like a shadow 
cast upon it which had resolved on the paper the instant be- 
fore he looked at it and which might fede, vanish, at any 
instant while he still read; the dead tongue speaking after the 
four years and then after almost fifty more, gentle sardonic 
whimsical and incurably pessimistk:, without date or saluta- 
tion or s%nature: 

You wilt notice how I insult neither of us iy claiming this to be 
a voice from the defeated even, let alone from the dead, hi fact, if I 
were a philosopher I should deduce and derive a curious and apt 
commentary on the times and augur of the future fiom this letter 
which you now hold in your hands — a sheet of notepaper with, as 
you can see, the best of French watermarks dated seventy years ago, 
salvaged (stolen if you will) from the gutted mansion of a ruined 
aristocrat; and written upon in the best of stove polish manufactured 
not Uvelve months ago in a New Englandfactory. Yes. Stove peU 
isk. We captured it: a story in itself. Jmcgine us, an assortment of 
homogeneous scarecrows, I wont say hungry because to a woman, 
l(dy or female either, below Masons and DixotCs in this year of 
grace 1865, that word would be sheer redundancy, like saying diat 
we were breeching. And I wont say ragged or even shoeless, ance 
we have been both long enough to have grown accustomed to it, 

129 



only, thank God {and this restores my faith not in human nature 
perhaps hut at least in man) that he really does not become inured 
to hardship and privation: it is only the mind, the gross omnivo- 
rous carrion-heavy soul which become inured; the body itself, 
thank God, never reconciled from the old soft feel of soap and clean 
linen and something between the sole of the foot and the earth to 
distinguish it from the foot of a beast. So say we merely needed am- 
munition. And imagine us, the scareaows with one of those con- 
cocted plans of scarecrow desperation which not only must but do 
work, for the reason that there is absolutely no room for alternative 
before man or heaven, no niche on earth or under it for failure to 
find space either to pause or breathe or be graved and sepulchered; 
and wc (the scarecrows) bringing it off with a great deal of elan, 
not to say noise; imagine, Isay, the prey and prize, the ten plump 
defenseless sutlers’ wagons, the scarecrows tumbling out box ffier 
beautiful box after beautiful box stenciled each with that U. and 
that S. which for four years now has been to us the symbol of the 
spoils which belong to the vanquished, of the loaves and the fishes 
as was once the incandescent Brow, the shining nimbus of the 
Thorny Crown; and the scarecrows clawing at the boxes with 
stones and bayonets and even with bare hands and opening them at 
last and finding — What? Stove polish. Gallons and gallons and 
gallons of the best stove polish, not a box of it a year old yet and 
doubtless still trying to overtake General Sherman with some be- 
lated amended field order requiring him to polish the stove before 
firing the house. How we laughed. Yes, we laughed, because I 
have learned this at least String these four years, that it redly re- 
quires an empty stomach to laugh with, diat only when you are 
hungry or frightened do you extract some tdtimate essKwee out of 
laughing just as the empty stomach extracts dte uMmate es^rwe 
out of cdcohol. But at least we have stove polish. We have plenty 
of it. We have too mudi, because U does not tdte mudt to say 



wntti I have to say, as you am see. And so the conclusion and au- 
gury which I draw, even though no philosopher, is this. 

We have waited long enough. You will notice how I do not in- 
sult you either hy saying I have ivaited long enough. And ther^ore, 
since I do not insult you hy saying that only I have waited, I 
not add, expect me. Because I cannot say when to expect me. Be- 
cause what WAS is one thing, and now it is not because it is 

dead, it died in iS6i, and ther^ore what IS [There. They 

have started firing again. Which — to mention it — is redundaticy too, 
like the breathing or the need of ammunition. Because sometimes I 
think it has never stopped. It hasn’t stopped of course; I dont man 
that. I mean, there has never been any more of it, that there was 
that one fusillade four years ago which sounded once and then was 
arrested, mesmerized raised muzzle hy raised muzzle, in the 
frozen attitude of its own aghast amazement and never repeated 
and it now only die loud aghast echo jarred by the dropped musket 
of a weary sentry or by the fall of the spent body itself, out of the 
air which lies over the land where that fusillade first sounded and 
where it must remain yet because no other space under Heaven will 
receive it. So that means that it is dawn again and that I must stop. 
Stop what? you will say. Why, thinking, remembering — remark 

that I do not say, hoping ; to become once more for a period 

without boundaries or location in time, mindless and irrational 
companion and inmate of a body which, even cfier four years, with 
a sort of disnud and incorruptible fidelity which is incredibly ad- 
mirable to me, is still immersed and obliviously bemused in recol- 
lections of old peace and contentment the very names of whose 
scents and sounds I do not know that I remember, which ignores 
even the presence and threat of a tom arm or leg as though through 
some secretly incurred and infallible promise and conviction of im- 
mortality. But to finish.) I cannot say when to expect me. Because 
what IS is somehing else again because it was not even alive then. 
And situx because within this sheet of paper you now hold the best 

131 



of the old South which is dead, and the words you read were writ~ 
ten upon it with the best {each box Sidd, the very best) of the new 
Morth which has conquered and wkidi therefore, whether it likes it 
or not, will have to survive, I now believe that you and I are, 
strangely enough, included among those who are doomed to live. 

“And diat’s all,” lAc Compson said. “Ske received it and 
sIm and Clytie made tlie wedding gown and the veil firom 
scraps — ^perhaps scraps intoided for, -wliich should have gone 
for, lint and did not. She didn’t know when he would come 
because he didn’t know hims elf: and maybe he told Henry, 
showed Henry the letter before he sent it, and maybe he did 
not; maybe still just the watching and the waiting, the one 
saying to Henry I have wdted long enough and Efenry saying 
to the other Do you renounce then? Do you renounce? and the 
other saying I do not renounce. For four years now I have given 
charae the opportunity to renounce for me, but it seems that I cm 
doomed to live, that she and I boA are doomed to live — the de- 
fiance and the ultimatum delivered beside a bivouac fire, the 
ultimatum discharged before the gate to which the two of 
them must have ridden side by side almost: the one calm and 
undeviating, perhaps unresisting evoi, fiitalist to the last; 
the other remorseless with implacable and unalterable gtief 

and despair *' (It seemed to Quentin that he could actu:- 

ally see them, facing one another at the gate. Inside the gate 
what was once a park now spread, unkempt, in shaggy des- 
olation, with an air dreamy, remote and aghast like die un- 
shavm fa&lt;» of a man just waking firom ether, up to a hu^

fiom stolen scraps, die house partaking too of that air of 
scaling desolation, not having sufiered firom invasion but a

odier on the tv/o gaunt horses, two men, young, not yet in 
the world, not yet breathed over long enough, to be old but 
with old eyes, with unkempt hair and feces gaunt and 
weathered as if east by some spartan and even niggard banrl 
from bronze, in worn and patched gray weathered now to 
the color of dead leaves, the one with the tarnished braid of 
an ojSScer, the other plain of cuff, the pistol lying yet across 
the saddle bow unaimed, the two feces calm, the voices not 
even raised: Dont you pass the shadow of this post, this branch, 

Charles; and I am going to pass it, Henry) “ and then 

Wash Jones sitting that saddleless mule before Miss Rosa’s 
gate, shouting her name into the sunny and peaceful quiet of

So they will have told you doubtless already how I told 
dutt Jones to take that mule which was not his around to the bam 
mid harness it to our buggy while I put on my hat and shawl and 
hched the house. That was dll I needed to do since they will have 
told you doubdess that I would have had no need for either trunk or 
hag since what dothing I possessed, now that the garments which I 
been fortunate enough to inherit fiom my aunt’s kindness or 
haste or oversight were long since worn out, consisted of the ones 
which Ellen had remembered fiom time to time to give me and now 
Ellen these two years dead; that I had only to lock the house and 
take my place in the buggy and traverse those twelve miles which 
I had not done since Elkn died, beside that brute who until Ellen 
died was not even permitted to approach the house fiom the front — 
thtt brute progenitor of brutes whose ^anddauglaer was to sup~ 
plant me, if not in my sister’ s house at least in my sister’ s bed to 
which {so they wiU tell you) I aspired— that brute who (brute in- 
strument of that justice whidi presides over human events which, 
incept in dte individual, runs smooth, less daw than velvet: but 
which, by man or womm flouted, drives on like fiery steel and 
overrides both weeddyfutt and unjust strong, both vtmquisher and 
imocent victimized, ruthless for appointed right and truth) brute 
who was not only to preside upon the various shc^es and avatars of 
Thomas Sutpen’s deviVsfate but was to provide at the last the fe- 
male flesh in which his name and lineage should he sepuldtered — 
diat brute who cleared to believe that he had served and per- 

m 




formed his appointed end by yelling of blood and pistols in the 
street before my house, who seemed to believe that whe^ further 
information he might have given me was too scant or too bland and 
free of moment to warrant the discarding of his tobacco cud, because 
during the entire sub^qiient twelve miles he could not even tell me 
what had happened. 

And hotv I traversed those same twelve miles once more after the 
two years since Ellen died (or was it the four years since Henry van- 
ished or was it the nineteen years since I saw light and breathed?) 
knotving nothing, able to learn nothing save this: a shot heard, faint 
and far away and even direction and source indeterminate, by tiva 
women, two young women alone in a rotting house where no 
mans footstep had sounded in two years — a shot, then an interval 
of aghast surmise above the cloth and needles which engaged them, 
then feet, in the hdl and then on the stairs, running, hurrying, the 
feet of a man: and Judith with just time to snatch up the unfinished 
dress and hold it before her as the door hurst open upon her brother, 
the wild murderer whom she had not seen in four years and whom 
she believed to be (if he was, ^ill lived and breathed at alt) a thou- 
sand miles away: and then the two of them,thetwoaccursedchildren 
on whom the first blow of their deviVs heritage had hut that mo- 
ment fiaUen, looking at one another across the up-raised and un- 
finished wedding dress. Twelve miles toward that I rode, beside 
an animal who could stand in the ifreef before my house and bellow 
placidly to the populous and listening solitude that my nephew had 
Just murdered his sisters fiance, yet who could not permit himself 
ta force the mule which drew us beyond a walk because'hit warnt 
none of mine nor hisn neither and besides hit aint had a decent bait 
of vittles since the com ^ve out in Februarf; who, turning into 
the actual gate at last, must stop ike mule and, pointing with the 
whip and spitting first, say ‘Hit was right yonder J — ‘ What was 
right there, fool?* I cried, and he: ‘Hit was* until I took the whip 
from him into my own hand and struck the mule. 

I3S 



But ^ley cannot tell you how J went on up the Jrive, past Mien’s 
ruined and weed-choked fiower beds and reached the 'house, the 
shell, the {so I thought) cocoon-casket marriage-ied of youth and 
gnf^ and found that I had come, not too late as I had thought, but 
come too soon. Rotting portico and seeding walls, it stood, not 
ravaged, not invaded, marked by no bullet nor soldier’s iron heel 
but rather as though reserved for something more: some desolation 
more profound than ruin, as if it had stood in ironjuxtaposition to 
iron flame, to a holocaust which had found itself lessfierce and less 
implacable, not hurled hut rather faUen back bfore the impervious 
and indomUdble skeleton which the flames durst not, at the instant’s 
final crisis, assail; there was even one step, one plarik rotted free 
and tilting beneath the foot {or would have if I had not touched it 
light and fast) as I ran up and into the hallway whose carpet had 
long since gone with the bed- and table-linen for lint, and saw the 
Sutpenface and even as I aied ‘Henry! Henry! What have you 
done? What has that fool been trying to tell me?’ realized that I 
had come, not too late as I had thought, but come too soon. Because 
it was not Henry’s face. It was Sutpenface enough, but not his; 
Sutpen coffee-colored face enough there in the dim light, barring 
the stairs: and I running out of the bright fftemoon, into the 
thunderous silence cf that brooding house where I could see nothing 
at first: dten gradually the face, the Sutpen face not approexhing, 
not swimming up out of the gloom, but already there, rocklike and 
firm and ankdating time and house and doom and dll, waiting 
there {oh yes, he chose well; he bettered choosing, who created in 
his own inufge the cold Cerberus of his private hell) — the face with- 
out sex or age because it had never possessed either: dte same 
sphinx face which she had been born with, whkh had looked down 
fiom the loft that night beside JudUh’s and which she stiU wears 
now at seventy-fim, looking at me with no charge, no alteration 
in it at all, as hough it had known to he second when I was to 
enter, had waitd here during hat entire twelve miles behind that 
136 



u/dking mule and wcdched me draw nearer and nearer and enter the 
door at last as it had known (ay, perhaps deaeed, since there is that 
justice whose Moloch’s palate-paunch makes no distinction between 
grisde bone and tetider Jlesh) that I would enter — ^The face stop- 
ping me dead [not my body: it still advanced, ran on: but I, myself, 
that deep existence which we lead, to which the movement of limbs 
is hut a dumsy and belated accompaniment like so many unneces- 
sary instruments played crudely and amateurishly out of time to 
the tune itself) in titat barren hall with its naked stair (that carpet 
gone too) rising into the dim upper hallway where an echo spoke 
which was not mine but rctiher that of the lost irrevocable might- 
have-been which haunts all houses, dl enclosed wdls ereOed by 
human hands, not for shelter, not for warmth, but to hide from the 
world’s curious looking and seeing the dark turnings which the an- 
cient young delusions of pride and hope and ambition (ay, and love 
too) take. ’Judith!’ I said, Judith!’ 

There was no answer, I had expected none; possibly even then I 
did not expect Judith to ansiver, just as a child, before the Jull in- 
stant of comprehended terror, cdls on the parent whom it actudly 
knows (this before the terror destroys dl judgment whatever) is 
not even there to hear it, I was crying not to someone, something, 
hut (trying to cry) through something, through that force, that furi- 
ous yet absolutely rocUike and immobile antagonism which had 
stopped me — that presence, that familiar coffee-colored face, that 
body (the bare coffee-colored feet motionless on the bare floor, the 
curve of the stair rising just beyond her) no larger than my cunt 
tvhich, without moving, with no alteration of visual displacement 
whenever (she did not even remove her gaze from mine for the 
reason that she was not hoking at me but through me, apparently 
still muting upon the open doors serene rectangle which I had 
broken) seemed to elongate and project upward something — not 
soul, not spirit, but somediitg rather of a profoundly attentive 
md distracted litiening to or for something which I myself codd 

m 



mt heat and was net intended ta hear — a brooding awareness and 
acceptance of the inexplicable unseen, inherited from an older and 
a purer race dum mine, which aeated postulated and shaped in 
the empty air between us that which I believed I had come to find 
{nay, which I must find, else breathing and standing there, I would 
have denied that I was ever born)— that bedroom long-closed and 
musty, that sheetless bed {that nuptial couch of love and grif) unth 
the pale and bloody corpse in its patched and weathered gray crim- 
soning the bare mattress, tJte bowed and unwived widow kneeling 
beside it — and I {my body) not stopping yet {yes, it needed the 
hand, die touch, for that) — I, self mesmered fool who still believed 
that what must be would be, could not but be, else I must deny 
sanity as well as breath, running, hurling myself into that inscru- 
table coffee-colored face, theU cold implacahle mindless {no, not 
mindless: anything but mindless: his own clairvoyant will tempered 
to amoral eviTs undeviating absolute by the black willing blood 
with which he had crossed it) replica of his own which he had 
created and decreed to preside upon his absence, as you might watch 
a mid distracted nighibound bird flutter into the brazen and fatal 
lamp. ‘ Wait/ she said. *Dont you go up there/ Still I did not stop; 
it would require the hand; and I stiU running on, accomplishing 
those last few feet across which we seemed to glare at one another 
not as two faces hut as the two abstract contradictions which we 
aduaUy were, neither of our voices raised, as though we spoke to 
one another fiee of the limitations and restrictions of speech and 
hearing. ‘What?’ I said. 

‘Dont you go up there, Rosa/ That was how she said it: dtat 
quiet, tke^ still, and again it was as though it had not been she who 
spoke hut ike house itself that said the words — the house which he 
had built, which some suppuration of himself had created about him 
as the sweat of his body might have produced some {even if invisible) 
cocoourlike and complementary shdl in which Ellen had had to 
Uve and die a stranger, in which Henry and Judith would have to 
138 



he victims and prisotms, or die. Because it was not the name, the 
word, the fact ikcA she had called me Rosa. As children she had 
called me that, Just as she had called them Henry and Judith; I knew 
that even now she still called Judith {and Henry too when she spoke 
of him) hy her given name. And she might very naturally have 
called me Rosa still, since to everyone else whom I knew I was still 
a child. But it was not that That was not what she meant at all; in 
fact, during that instant while we stood face to face {that instant be- 
fore my still advancing body shouU brush past her and reach the 
stair) she did me more grace and respect dwt anyone else I knew; I 
knew that from the instant I had entered that door, to her of all who 
knew me I was no child. ‘Rosa?' I cried. ‘To me? To my face?' 
Then she touched me, and then I did stop dead. Possibly even then 
my body did not stop, since I seemed to be aware of it thrusting 
blindly still against the solid yet imponderable weight {sIk not 
owner: instrument; I still say that) of that will to bar me fiom the 
stairs; possibly the sound of the odter voice, the single word spoken 
fiom the stairhead above us, had already broken and parted us be- 
fore it {my body) had even paused. I do not know. I know only that 
my entire being seemed to run at blind full tib into something mon- 
strous and immobile, widi a shocking impact too soon and top quick 
to be mere amazement and outrage at that black arresting and un- 
timorous hand on my white woman's flesh. Because there is some- 
thing in the touch of flesh with flesh which dbrogates, cuts sharp and 
straight across the ^ious intricate channels of decorous ordering, 
which enemies as well as lovers know because it mdkes them both — 
touch and touch of hcU which is the citadel of he centred I-Ams pri- 
vate own: not spirit, soul; he liquorish and ungirdled mind is any- 
one's to tdke in any darkened hallway of his earthly tenement. But 
let flesh touch wih flesh, and watch the fall of all the eggshell shib- 
boleh of caste and color too. Yes, I stopped dead— no woman's 
hand, no negro's hand, but bitted bridle-curb to check cmd guide he 
furious and unbending will— I crying not to her, to it; speaking to 

139 



U throi^h the negro, the woman, only because of the shock which 
was not yet outrage because it would be tenor soon, expecting and 
receiving no answer because we both knew it was not to her I 
spoke: ^ Take your hand off me, nigger!’ 

I got none. We just stood there — I motionless in the attitude and 
action of running, she rigid in that furious immobility, the two of 
us joined by that hand and arm which held us, like a fierce rigid 
umbilical card, twin sistered to the fell darkness which had pro- 
duced her. As a child I had more than once wtOched her and Judith 
and even Henry scuffling in the rough games which they {possibly 
all diildren; I do not know) played, and {so I have heard) she and 
Judith even slept together, in the same room but with Judith in the 
bed and she on a pallet on the floor ostensibly. But I have heard 
how on more than once occasion Ellen has found them both,on the 
pallet, and once in tlte bed together. But not I. Even as a child, I 
would not even play with the same objects which she and Judith 
played with, as though that warped and spartan solitude whidt I 
called my childhood, which had taught me {and little else) to listen 
bffore I could comprehend and to understand before I even heard, 
had also taught me not only to instinctively fear her and what she 
was, but to shun the very objects which she had touched. We ttood 
there so. And then suddenly it was not outage that I waited for, 
out of which I had instinctively cried; it was not terror: it was some 
cumulative over-reach of despair itself. I remember how as we stttod 
there joined by that volitionless {yes: it too sentient vioimjust as 
she and I were) hand, I aied— perhaps not cdoud, not with words 
{and not to Judith, mind: perhaps I knew already, on the instant I 
entered the house and saw that face which was at once both mm 
and less than Sutpen, perhaps I knew even that what I could net, 
would not, must not believe) — I cried ‘And you too? And you too, 
sister, sister?* What did I expect? I, selfmesmered fool, exmie 
twelve miles expecting — what? Henry perhcps, to emerge from 
some door which knew his touch, his hand on die knob, the weight 
140 



of his foot on a sill which knew that weight: and so to find standing 
in the hall a small plain frightened creature whom neither man nor 
woman had ever looked at twice, whom he had not seen himself in 
four years and seldom enough before that but whom he would recog- 
nize if only because of the worn brown silk which had once become 
his mother and because the creature stood there calling him by his 
given name? Henry to emerge and say ‘Why, it's Rosa, Aunt 
Rosa. Wcdee up, Aunt Rosa; wake up’? — I, the dreamer clinging 
yet to the dream as the patient clings to the last thin unbearable 
ecstatic instant of agony in order to sharpen the savor of the pain’s 
surcease, waking into the reality, the more than reality, not to the 
unchanged and unaltered old time but into a time altered toft the 
dream which, conjunctive with the dremner, becomes immolated and 
apotheosized: ‘Mother and Judith are in the nursery with the chil- 
dren, and Father and Charles are walking in the garden. Wake up, 
Aunt Rosa; wake up*? Or not expect perhaps, not even hope; not 
even dream since Yearns dont come in pairs, and had I not come 
twelve miles drawn not by mortal mule but by some ddmaera-foal 
of nightmare’s very self? {Ay, wake up, Rosa; wake up — not from 
what was, what used to be, but from what had not, could not have 
ever, been; wrdee, Rosa — not to what should, what might have 
been, hut to what cannot, what must not, be; wdl«, Rosa, from 
die hoping, who did believe there is a seemliness to bereavement 
even &amp;ough grief be absent; believed there would be need for you 
to save not love perhaps, not happiness mr peace, but what was 
left behind by widowing — and found that time was nothing there 
to save; who hoped to save her as you promised Ellen {not Charles 
Bon, not Henry: not either one of these from him or even from one 
mother) and now too late, who would have been too la^ if you had 
come therefrom die wond&gt; mr had been there dready at the frdl 
Orong capdle mortal peak when she was bom; who came twelve 
miles and nineteen years to save what did not need die saiHng, and

141 



I found only that dream-state in which you run without moving 
from a terror in which you cannot believe, toward a safety in whidi 
you have no faith, held so not by the shifting and foundationless 
quicksand of nightmare but by a face which was its souVs own in- 
quisitor, a hand which was the agent of its own crucifixion, until 
the voice parted us, broke the spell. It said one word: ‘Clytie’ like 
that, that cold, that still: not Judith, but the house itself speaking 
again, though it was Judith’s voice. Oh, I knew it well, who had 
believed ingrieving’s seemliness; I knew it as well as she — Clpie 
— htew it. She did not move; it was only the hand, the hand gone 
before I realized that it had been removed. I do not know if she re- 
moved it or if I ran out from beneath its touch. But it was gone; cmd 
this too they cannot tell you: How I ran, jied, up the stairs and 
found no grieving widowed bride but Judith standing before the 
closed door to that chamber, in the gingham dress which she had 
worn each time I had seen her since Ellen died, holding something 
in one hanging hand; and if there had been grief or anguish she had 
put them too away, complete or not complete I do not know, dong 
with that unfinished wedding dress. ’Yes, Rosa?’ she said, like 
that again, and I stopped in running’s midstride again though my 
body, blind unsentient barrow of deluded clay and breath, still ad- 
vanced: And how I saw that what she held in that lax and negligent 
hand was the photograph, the picture of herself in its n^d case 
which she had given him, held casual and forgotten against her 
flank as any interrupted pastime book. 

Thais what I found. Perhaps it’s what I expected, knew (even 
at nineteen knew, I would say if it were not for my nineteen, my 
own particular kind of nineteen years) that I shouUfind. Perhaps 
I couldn’t even have wanted more than that, couldn’t have accepted 
less, who even at nineteen must have known that living is one 
conawtt cmd perpetual instcmt when the arras^eil before what-is- 
to-be hangs hale and even glad to the lightest ndted thrust if we 
had dared, were brave enou;^ (not wise enough: no wisdom needed 
142 



here) to make the rending gash. Or perhaps it is no lack of courage 
either: not cowardice which will not face that sickness somewhere 
at the prime foundation of this factual scheme from which the 
prisoner soul^ miasmal-^distillant, wroils ever upward sunward, 
tugs its tenuous prisoner arteries and veins and prisoning in its turn 
that spark, that dream tvhich, as the glohy and complete instant of 
its freedom mirrors and repeats {repeats? creates, reduces to a fragile 
evanescerU iridescent sphere) all of space and time and massy earth, 
relids the seething and anonymous miasmal mass which in all the 
years of time has taught itself no boon of death hut otily how to re-* 
create, renew; and dies, is gone, vanished: nothing — but is that 
true wisdom which can comprehend that there is a might-dxave-ieen 
which is more true than truth, from which the dreamer, waking, 
says not ^Did I but dream?^ but rather says, indicts high heavens 
very self with: ^Why did I wake since waking I shall never sleep 
again?* 

Once there was — Do you mark how the wistaria, sun-impacted 
on this wall here, distills and penetrates this room as though {light-- 
unimpeded) by seaet and attritive progress from mote to mote of 
obscurity s myriad components? That is the substance of remember- 
ing — sense, sight, smell: the muscles with which we see and hear 
and feel — not mind, not thought: there is no such thing as memory: 
the brain recalbjust what the muscles grope for: no more, no less: 
and its resultant sum is usually incorrect and false and worthy only 
of the name of dream, — See how the sleeping outflung hand, touch- 
ing the bedside candle, remembers pain, springs back and free while 
mind and brain sleep on and only make of this adjacent heat some 
trashy myth of reality s escape: or that same sleeping hand, in 
sensuous marriage with some dulcet surface, b transformed by that 
same sleeping brain and mind into that same figment-stuff warped 
cut of all experience. Ay, grief goes, fades; we know that — but ask 
the tear ducts if they have forgotten how to weep. — Once there was 
{they cmnot have told you thb either) a summer of wbtaria. It was 

143 



a pervading everywhere uHstaria (I was fourteen then) as diough 
of all springs yet to capitulate condensed into one spring, one sum- 
mer: the spring and summertime which is every female’s who 
breathed above dust, beholden of dl betrayed springs held over fiom 
all irrevocable time, repercussed, bloomed again. It was a vintage 
year of wistaria: vintage year being that sweet conjunction of root 
bloom ard urge and hour cmd weather; and I (I was fourteen) — I 
will not insist on bloom, at whom no man had yet U&gt; look— nor 
would ever— twice, as not as child htt less than even child; as not 
more child than woman but even as less than any femede flesh. Nor 
do Isay le&lt;f— warped bitter pale and crimped half-fledging intimi- 
date of any claim to green which might have drawn to it the tender 
mayfly childhood sweetheart games or given pause to the male pre- 
dacious wasps and bees of later lust. But root and urge I do insist 
and claim, for had I not heired too from all the unsistered Eves 
since the Snake? Yes, urge I do: warped chrysalis of what blind 
perfect seed: for who shall say what gnarled forgotten root might 
not bloom yet with some globed concentrate more globed and con- 
centrate and heady^erfect because the neglected root was planted 
warped and lay not dead but merely slept forgot? 

That was the miscast summer of my barren youth which (for 
dust short time, that short brirf unreturning springtime &lt;rf die fe- 
male heart) I lived out not as a woman, a girl, but rather as the 
man which I perhaps should have been. I was fourteen then, four- 
teen in years if they could have been called years while in that uttr- 
pasxd corridor which I called childhood, which was not living hut 
radter some projection of the lightless womb itself; I gestate md 
(ximplete, not aged, just overdue because of some caesarean lade, 
some cold head-nuzzling forceps of the savage time whidt should 
have tom me flee; I wait^ not for light but for that doom which we 
add female victory which is: en^e and then endure, widiout 
rhyme or reason or hope of reward— and then endure; I Idee ihei 
Mbfd subterranean flsh, that insulated ^ark whox origin dte fldi 
144 



no longer remembers, which pubes and beats at Us crepuscular and 
lethargic tenement vAth the old unsleeping itch which has no words 
to speak with other than 'This was called light* that 'smell* that 
'touch/ that other something which has bequeathed not even name 
for sound of bee or bird or flowers scent or light or sun or love — yes, 
not even growing and developing, beloved by and loving light, but 
equipped only with that cunning, that inverted canker^growth of 
solitude tvhich substitutes the omnivorous and unrationd hearing-^ 
sense for all the others: so that instead of accomplishing the proces- 
sional and measured milestones of the childhood* s time I lurked, un- 
apprehended as though, shod with the very damp and velvet silence 
of the womb, I displaced no air, gave off no betraying sound, from 
me closed forbidden door to the next and so acquired all I knetv of 
that light and space in which people moved and breathed as I (that 
same child) might have gained conception of the sun from seeing it 
through a piece of smoky glass— fourteen, four years younger than 
Judith, four years later than JuditUs moment which only virgins 
know: when the entire delicate spirits bent is me anonymous cU- 
maxless epicene and unravished nuptial — not that widowed and 
nightly violation by the inescapable and scornful dead which is the 
meed of tiventy and thirty and forty, but a world filled with living 
marriage like the light and air which she breathes. But it was no 
summer of a virgins itching discontent; no summer s caesarean lack 
which should have tom me, dead flesh or even embryo, from the 
living: or else, by frictions ravishing of the male-furrowed meatj 
also weaponed and panoplied as a man instead of hollow woman. 

It was the summer after that first Christmas that Henry brought 
him home, the summer following the two days of that June vocch 
tion which he spent at Sutpens Hundred before he rode on to the 
fiver to take the steamboat home, that summer after my aunt left 
md papa had to go away on business and I was sent out to Ellen 
{possibly my father chose Ellen as a refuge far me because at that 
time Thomas Sutpen was also absent) to stay so that she could take 

145 



care of me, who had been bom too late, bom into some curious dis- 
joint of my fathers life and Ifi on his (now twice) widowed hands, 
I competent enough to reach a kitchen shelf, count spoons and hem 
a sheet and measure milk into a chum yet good for nothing else, yet 
still too valuable to he left alone. I had never seen him (I never saw 
him. I never even saw him dead. I heard a name, I saw a photo- 
graph, I helped to make a grave: and that was all) though he had 
been in my house once, that first New Year s Day when Henry 
brought him from nephew duty to speak to me on their way hack to 
school and I was not at home. Until then I had not even heard his 
name, did not know that he existed. Yet on the day when I went 
out there to stay that summer, it was as though that casual pause at 
my door had left some seed, some minute virulence in this cellar 
earth of mine quick not for love perhaps {I did not love him; how 
could I? I had never even heard his voice, had only Ellens word 
for it that there was such a person) and quick not for the spying 
which you will doubtless call it, which during the past six months 
between that New Years and that June gave substance to that 
shadow with a name emerging from Ellen’s vain and garrulous 
folly, that shape without even a face yet because I had not even seen 
the photograph then, reflected in the secret and bemused gaze of a 
young girl: because I who bad learned nothing of love, not even 
parents’ love — that fond dear constant violation of privacy, that 
stukification of the burgeoning and incorrigible I which is the meed 
Mtd due of all mammalian meat, became not mistress, not beloved, 
but more that even love; I became all polymath love’s androgynous 
•advocate. 

There must have been some seed he left, to cause a child’s vacant 
fairy-tale to come alive in that garden. Because I was not spying 
when I would follow her. I was not spying, though you will say 1 
was. And even if it was spying, it was not jealousy, because I did 
not love him. (How could I have, when I had never seen him?) 
And even if I did, rwt as women love, as Judith loved him, or as 
146 



ti/e thought she did. If it was love {and I still say. How could it be?) 
it was the way that mothers love when, punishing the child she 
strikes not it but through it strikes the neighbor boy whom it has 
just whipped or been ivhipped by; caresses not the rewarded child 
blit rather the nameless man or woman who gave the palm-sweated 
penny. But not as women love. Because I asked nothing of hitHy 
you see. And more than that: I gave him nothing, which is ike sum 
of loving. Why, I didnt even miss him. I dont know even now if I 
was ever aware that 1 had seen nothing of his face but that photo- 
graph, that shadow, that picture in a young girYs bedroom: a pic- 
ture casual and framed upon a littered dressing table yet bowered 
and dressed {or so I thought) with all the maiden and invisible lily 
roses, because even before I saw the photograph I could have recog- 
nized, nay, described, the very face. But I never saw it. I do not 
even know of my own knowlege that Ellen ever saw it, that Judith 
ever loved it, that Henry slew it: so who will dispute me when 1 
say, Why did I not invent, create it? — A^td I know this: if I were 
God I would invent out of this seething turmoil we call progress 
something (a machine perhaps) which would adorn the barren 
mirror altars of every plain girl who breathes with such as this — 
which is so little since we want so little — this pictured face. It would 
not even need a skull behind it; almost anonymous, it would only 
need vague inference of some walking flesh and blood desired by 
someone else even if only in some shadow-realm of make-believe. 
— A picture seen by stealth, by creeping {my childhood taught me 
that instead of love and it stood me in good stead; in fact, if it had 
taught me love, love could not have stood me so) into the deserted 
midday room to look at it Not to dream, since I dwelt in the dream, 
but to renew, rehearse, the part as the faulty though eager amateur 
might steal wingward in some interim of the visible scene to hear 
the prompter s momentary voice. And if jealousy, not mans Jed- 
ousy, the Jealousy of the lover; not even the lover s self who spies 
from love, who spies to watch, taste, touch that maiden revery of 

U7 



solitude which is the first thinning of that veil we call virginity; 
not to spring out, force that shame which is such a part of love’s de- 
claring, hut to gloat upon the rich instantaneous bosom already rosy 
with thefiushy sleep though shame itself does not yet need to wake. 
No, it was not that; I was not spying, who would walk those raked 
and sanded garden paths and think ‘This print was his save for this 
obliterating rake, that even despite the take it is still there and hers 
beside it in that slow and mutual rhythm wherein the heart, the 
mind, does not need to watch the docile {ay, the willing) feet’; 
would think ‘What suspiration of the tivmning souls have the 
murmurous myriad ears of this secluded vine or shrub listened to? 
what vow, what promise, what rapt biding fire has the lilac rain 
of this wistaria, this heavy rose’s dissolution, crowned?’ But best 
of all, better far than this, the actual living and the dreamy flesh it- 
self. Oh no, I was not spying while I dreamed in the lurking har- 
borage of my own shrub or vine as I believed she dreamed upon the 
moky seat which held invisible imprint of his absent thighs just as 
the obliterating sand, the million finger-nerves of frond and leaf, 
the very sun and moony constellations which had looked doum at 
him, the circumambient air, held somewhere yet his foot, his pass- 
ing shape, his face, his specddng voice, his name: Charles Bon, 
Charles Good, Charles Husband-soon-to-be. No, not spying, not 
even hiding, who was child enough not to need to hide, whose pres- 
ence would have been no violation even though he sat with her, yet 
woman enough to have gone to her entitled to be received (perhaps 
with pleasure, gratitude) into that maiden shameless confidence 
where young girls talk of love — Yes, child enough to go to her and 
say ‘Let me sleep with you; woman enough to say ‘Let us lie in 
bed together while you tell me what lov^ is,* yet who did not do it 
because I should have had to say ‘Dont talk ^ me of love but let 
sue tell you, who know already more of love than you will ever 
know or need.’ Then my father returned and came for me and took 
me home and I became t^ain that nondesaipt too long a &lt;ddld yet 
148 



too short a woman, in the JitUss garments which my aunt had leji 
behind, keeping a jitless house, who was not spying, hiding, but 
waiting, watching, for no reward, no thanks, who did not love him 
in the sense we mean it because there b no love of that sort without 
hope; who {if it were love) loved with that sort beyond the compass 
of glib booh: that love which gives up what it never had— that 
penny's modicum which is the donors all yet whose infinitesimal 
wei^tt adds nothing to the substance of the loved— and yet I gave 
it. Aid not to him, to her; it was as though 1 said to her, 'Here, 
take this too. You cannot love him as he should be loved, aid 
dwugh he will no more feel this giving's weight than he would ever 
know its lack, yet there may come some moment in your married 
lives when he will find this atom's particle as you might find a 
cramped small pallid hidden shoot in a familiar flower bed and 
pause and say, “Where did this come from?'*; you need only an- 
swer, “I dont htow.'" And then I went back home atd stayed five 
years, heard an echoed shot, ran up a nightmare flight of stairs, 
and found 

V^y, a woman standing calmly in a gingham dress before a 
closed door which she would not allow me to enter— a woman more 
strange to me than to any gri^for being so less its partner — a 
woman saying ‘Yes, Rosa?' calmly into th midstride of my run- 
ning whick (I know it now) had begun five years ago, since he had 
been in my house too, and had lefi no more trem than he had Irft in 
J^lm's, where he had been but a shape, a shadow: not of a man, 
a being, but of some esoteric piece of furniture — vase or chair or 
desk — which Mien wanted, as though his very impression {or lack 
if it) on CoUfield or Sutpen wcMs held porkntous prophecy of 
what was to be — Yes, running out of that first year {that year he- 
firre the War) during which Mien talked tome of trousseau {and 
it my ^aussem), of all the dreamy panoply of surrender whick was 
my smender, who had so little to surrender thctt it was dl I had 
beecmx there is tka tnight-kave-bmt whick is die single rodt we 

149 



ding to above the maelstrom of unbearable reality — The four years 
while I believed she waited as I ivaited, while the stable world we 
had been taught to knotv dissolved in fire and smoke until peace and 
security were gone, and pride and hope, and there was I ft only 
maimed honors veterans, and love. Yes, there should, there must, 
he love and faith: these left with us by fathers, husbands, sweet- 
hearts, brothers, who carried the pride and the hope of peace in 
honors vanguard as they did the flags; there must be these, else 
what do men fight for? what else worth dying for? Yes, dying not 
for honor's empty sake, nor pride nor even peace, but for that love 
and faith they Ifi behind. Because he was to die; I htow that, 
knew that, as both pride and peace were: else how to prove love’s 
immortdity? But not love, not faith itself, themselves. Love with- 
out hope perhaps, faith with little to be proud with: but love and 
faith at least above the murdering and the folly, to salvage at least 
from the humbled indicted dust something anyway of the old lost 
enchantment of the heart. — Yes, found her standing before that 
closed door which I was not to enter (and which she herself did not 
enter again to my knowledge until Jones and the other man carried 
the coffin up the stairs) with the photograph hanging at her side 
and her face absolutely calm, looking at me for a moment and just 
raising her voice enough to be heard in the hall below: ‘Clytie. 
Miss Rosa will he here for dinner; you had better get out some 
more meed’: then ‘Shall we go down stairs? I will have to speak to 
Mr Jones about some planks and nails’ 

That was all. Or rather, not all, since there is no all, no finish; 
it not the blow we suffer from but the tedious repercussive anti- 
climax of it, dw rubbishy aftermath to clear away from off the very 
threshold of despair. You see, I never saw him. I never even saw 
him dead. I heard an echo, but not the shot; I saw a closed door but 
did not enter it: I remember how that afternoon when we carried 
die coffin from the house {Jones and another white man which he 
produced, exhumed, from somewhere made it of boards tom from 

150 



the carriage house; I remember how while we ate the food which 
Judith — yes j Judith: the same face cahn^ cold and tranquil above the 
stove — had cooked^ ate it in the very room which he lay ox^er, we 
could hear them hammering and sawing in the back yard, and how 
I saw Judith once, in a faded gingham sunhonnet to nMtch the 
dress, giving them directions about making it; I remember how dur-^ 
ing all that slow and sunny afternoon they hammered and sawed 
right under the back parlor window — the slow, maddening rasp, 
rasp, rasp, of the saw, the flat deliberate hammer blows that seemed 
as though each would be the last hut was not, repeated and resumed 
just when the dulled attenuation of the wearied nerves, stretched 
beyond all resiliency, relaxed to silence and then had to scream 
again: until at last I went out there {and saw Judith in the barnlot 
in a cloud of chickens, her apron cradled about the gathered eggs) 
and asked them why^ why there? why must it be Just there? and 
they both stopped long and more than long enough for Jones to turn 
and spit again and say, ^Because hit wouldnt be so fur to tote the 
box : and how before my very back was turned he — one of them — 
added further, gut of some amazed and fumbling ratiocination of 
inertia, how *Hit would be simpler yit to fetch him down and nail 
the planks around him, only maybe Missus Judy wouldnt like hit. 
“I remember how as we carried him down the stairs and out to 
the waiting wagon I tried to take the full weight of the coffin to 
prove to myself that he was really in iL And X could not tell. I was 
one of his pallbearers, yet I could not, would not believe something 
which I knew could not but be so. Because I never saw him. You 
see? There are some things which happen to us which the intelli^ 
gence and the senses refuse just as the stomach sotnetimes refuses 
what the palate has accepted but which digestion cannot compass — 
occurrences which stop us dead as though by some impalpable inter-^ 
vention, like a sheet of glass through which we watch all subsequent 
events transpire as tJumgh in a soundless vacuum, and fade, vanish; 
are gone, leaving us immobile, impotent, helpless; Jtxed, until we 

iSi 



can die. That was 1. 1 was there; sotneihing of me waiked in meas- 
ured cadence with the measured tread of Jones and his companion, 
and Tfieophitus McCaslm who had heard the news somehow back 
in town, and Clytie as we bore the awkward and unmanageable 
box past the stairs close turning while Judith, following, steadied 
it from behind, and so down and out to the wagon; something of 
me helped to raise that which it could not have raised alone yet 
which it still could not believe, into the waiting wagon; something 
of me stood beside thegashy earth in the cedars* somber gloom and 
heard the clumsy knell of clods upon the wood and answered No 
when Judith at the graves mounded end said, ‘He was a Catholic. 

Do any of you all know how Ccuholks and Theophilus 

McCasUn said, ‘Catholic be damned; he was a soldier. And I can 
pray for any Confedrit soldier and then cried in his old mans shrill 
harsh loud cacophonous voice: ‘Yaaaay, Forrest! Yaaaay, John 
Sartoris! Yaaaaaayl* And something walked with Judith and 
Clytie hack across that sunset f eld and answered in some curious 
serene suspension to the serene quiet voice which talked of plowing 
corn and cutting winter wood, and in the lamplit kitchen helped 
this time to co^ the meal and helped to eat it too within the room 
beyond whose ceiling he no longer lay, and went to bed {yes, took 
a candle from thatfrm untrembling hand and thought ‘She did not 
even weep* and then in a lamp-gloomed mirror saw my own face 
1 and thought ‘Nor did you either) tvithin that house where he had 
sojourned for another brif {and this time final) space and left no 
trace of him, not even tears. Yes. One day he was not. Then he 
was. Then he was not. It was too short, too fast, too quick; six 
hours of a summer afternoon saw it all — a space too short to leave 
even the imprint of a body on a mattress, and blood can come from 
anywhere — if there was blood, since I never saw him. For all I was 
fdlowed to Imow, we had no corpse; we even had no murderer (we 
did not even speak of Henry that day, not one of us; I did not say 
— the auni, ^ sprwter—^Did he look well or ill?* I did not say 

4'52 



one of the thousand trivial ihings with which the indomittAle 
woman-hlood ignores the man's world in which the blood kinsman 
shows tlte courage or cowardice, the folly or Ittst or fear, for which 
his fellows praise or crucify him) who came and crashed a door and 
cried his crime and vanished, who for the fact that he was still alive 
was just that much more shadowy than the cAstraction which we 
had nailed into a box — a shot heard only by its echo, a strange 
gaunt half-wild horse, bridled and with empty saddle, the saddle 
bags containing a pistol, a worn clean shirt, a lump of iron-like 
bread, captured by a man four miles away and two days later while 
trying to force the crib door in his stable. Yes, more than that: he 
was absent, and he was; he returned, and he was not; three ivomen 
put something into the earth and covered it, and he had never been. 

Now you will ask me why I stayed there. I could say, I do not 
know, could give ten thousand paltry reasons, all untrue, end be 
believed — that I stayed for food, who could have combed ditch- 
banks and weed-beds, made and worked a garden as well at my own 
home in town as here, not to speak of neighbors, friends whose alms 
I might have accepted, since necessity has a way of obliterating 
from our conduct'various delicate scruples regarding honor and 
pride; that I stayed for shelter, who had a roof of my own in fee 
simple now indeed; or that I stayed for company, who at home 
could have had the company of neighbors who were at least of my 
own kind, who had known me all my life and even longer in the 
sense that they thought not only as I thought but as my forbears 
thought, while here I had for company one woman whom, for all 
she was blood kin to me, I did not understand and, if what my ob- 
servation warranted me to believe was true, I did not wish to under- 
stand, and another who was so foreign to me and to dll that I was 
that we might have been not only of different races l^vhich we 
were), not otdy of different ^es {which we were not), hut of dif- 
ferent species, speaking no languige which the other understood, 
ike very simple words with whi^ we were forced to adjust out 

m 



■lays to one another being even less inferetUud of thought or inten- 
tion than the sounds which a beast and a bird might make to each 
other. But I dont say any of these. I stayed there and waited for 
Thomas Suipen to come home. Yes. You will say {or believe) 
that I waited even then to become engaged to him; if I said I did not, 
you would believe I lied. But J do say 1 did not. I waited for him 
exactly as Judith and Clytie waited for him: because now he was 
all we had, all that gave us any reason for continuing to exist, to 
eat food and sleep and wake and rise again: knowing that he would 
need us, knoiving as we did {who knew him) that he would begin 
at once to salvage what was left of Sutpens Hundred and restore 
it. Not that we would or did need him. {I had never for one instant 
thought of marriage, never for one instatU imagined that he would 
look at me, see me, since he never had. You may believe me, be- 
cause I shall make no bones to say so when the moment comes to 
tell you when I did think of it.) No. It did not even require the first 
day of the life we were to lead together to show us that we did not 
need him, had not the need for any man so long as Wash Jones 
lived or stayed there — I who had kept my fathers house and he 
alive for almo^ four years, Judith who had done the same out here, 
and Clytie who could cut a cord of wood or run a furrow better {or 
at least quicker) than Jones himself. — And this the sad fact, one 
of the saddest: that weary tedium which the heart and spirit feel 
when they no longer need that to whose need they {the spirit and 
the heart) are necessary. No. We did not need him, not even vi- 
cariously, who could not even join him in his furious {that almost 
mad intention which he brought home with him, seemed to project, 
radiate ahead of him before he even dismounted) desire to restore 
the place to what it had been that he had sacrificed pity and gentle- 
ness and love and alt the soft virtuesfor—ifhe had ever had them 
to sacrifice, feU their lack, desired them of others. Nat even thaL 
Neither Judith nqr I wanted that. Perltaps it was because we did 
not believe it could he done, but I think it was more than dtat: diat 

154 



we now existed in an apathy which was almost petae, like that of 
die blind msentient earth itself which dreams after no flowed s 
stalk nor bud^ envies not the airy musical solitude of the springing 
leaves it nourishes. 

So we waited for him. We led the busy eventless lives of three 
nuns in a barren and poverty-stricken convent: the walls we had 
were safe, impervious enough, even if it did not matter to the wads 
whether we ate or not. And amicably, not as two white women 
and a negress, not as three negroes or three white, not even as three 
women, but merely as three creatures who still possessed the need to 
eat but took no pleasure in it, the need to sleep but from no joy in 
weariness or regeneration, and in whom sex was some forgotten 
atrophy like the rudimentary gills we call the tonsils or the still- 
opposable thumbs for old climbing. We kept the house, what part of 
it we lived in, used; we kept the room which Thomas Sutpen 
would return to— not that one which he left, a husband, but die one 
to which he should return a sonless widower, barren of that pos- 
terity which he doubtless must have wanted who had gone to the 
trouble and expense of getting children and housing them among 
imported furniture beneath crystal chandeliers— just as we kept 
Henry s room, as Judith and Clytie kept it that is, as if he had not 
runup the stairs that summer cftemoon and dien ran down agcdn; 
we grew and tended and harvested with our own hands the food we 
ate, made and worked that garden just as we cooJxd and ate tite 
food which came out of it: witii no distinction among the three of us 
of age or color but just as to who could build this fire or stir tltis pot 
or weed this bed or carry this apron full of com to the mill for meed 
with least cost to the general good in time or expense cf other duties. 
It was as though we were one being, interchaigecAle and indis- 
criminate, which kept that garden pouting, spun diread and wove 
die cloth we wore, hunted and found and rendered die meeker 
ditch-tide herbs to protea and guarantee what spartan compromise 
we dared orhadth time to make with ittness,.hmied and nagged

that Jones into working the com and cutting the wood which was 
to he our winters warmth and sustenance — the three of us, three 
women: I drafted by circumstance at too soon an age into a pinch- 
penny housewifery which might ham existed just as well upon a 
lighthouse rock, which had not even taught me how to cultivate a 
bed of flowers, let alone a kitchen garden, which had taught me to 
look upon fuel and meat as something appearing by its own volition 
in a woodbox or on a pantry shelf; Judith created by circumstatice 
{circumstance? a hundred years of careful nurturing, perhaps not 
by blood, not even Coldfield blood, but certainly by the tradition 
in which Thomas Sutpetis ruthless tvill had carved a niche) to pass 
through the soft insulated and unscathed cocoon stages: bud, served 
prolific queen, then potent and soft-handed matriarch of old age's 
serene and well-lived content— Judith handicapped by what in me 
was a few yeari ignorance but ivhich in her was ten generations 
&lt;f iron prohibition, who had not learned that first principle of pen- 
ury which is to scrimp and save for the sake of scrimping and sav- 
ing, who {and abetted by Clytie) would cook twice what we could 
eat and three times what we could afford and give it to anyone, any 
stranger in a land already beginning to fill with straggling soldiers 
who stopped and adied for it; and {but not least) Clytie. Clytie, 
not inept, anything but inept: perverse inscrutable and paradox: 
free, yet incapable of freedom who had never once called herself a 
dave, holding fidelity to none like the indolent and solitary wolf 
or bear {yes, wild: half untamed blade, half Sutpen blood: and if 
‘untamed' he sytumymous with ‘wild,' then ‘Sutpen' is the silent 
unsleeping vidousness of the tamer's lash) whose false seeming 
holds it docile to fear s hand but which is not, which if this befidel- 
hy, fidelity only to the prime fixed principle of its own savageness; 
— Clytie who in the very pigmentation of her flesh represented 
that dehade which had brought Judith and me to what we were and 
which had made of her {Clytie) that which she declined to beju^ 
as she had decMmd to he that from which its purpose had hem to ’ 
156 



emancipate her, as though presiding doof upon the new, she de- 
liberately remained to represent to us the threatful portettt of the old. 

We were three strangers. I do not know what Clytie thought, 
wltat life site led which the food we raised and cooked in unison, the 
cloth we spun and wove together, nourished and sheltered. But I 
expected that because she and I were open, ay honorable, enemies. 
But I did not even know what Judith thought and felt. We slept in 
the same room, the three of us {this for more than to conserve the 
firewood which we had to carry in ourselves. We did it for safety. 
It was winter soon attd dready soldiers were beginning to come 
hack — the stragglers, not all of them tramps, ruffiatts, but men who 
had risked and lost everything, suffered beyond endurance and had 
returned now to a ruined land, not the same men who had marched 
away but iranformed — and this the worst, the ultimate degradation 
to which war brings the spirit, the sod — into the likeness of that 
man who abuses from very despair and pity the beloved wife ot 
mistress who in his absence has been raped. We were ffraid. We 
fed diem; we gave them what and all we had and we would have 
assumed their wounds and left them whole again if we amid. But 
we were cficud of them.), we waked and fulfilled the endless teMous 
obligations which the sheer holding to life and breath entailed; we 
wodd sit before the fire cfier supper, the three cfusin dtat state 
where the very bones ard musdes are too tired to rest, when the 
attenuated and invincible spirit has dianged and shewed even hope- 
lessness into the easy obliviousness of a worn garment, and talk, 
tdk of a hundred things — the weary recurrent trivia of our daily 
lives, of a dtousand things but not of one. We talked cf him, 
Thomas Sutpen, of the ^ of the War (we could dl see it now) 
and when he would return, of what he wodd do: how begin the 
Herculean task whuk we hww ie would set hunself, into which 
(oh yes, we knew this too) he would undoditedly sweep us with 
die old ruthlessmss whedier we would or no; we talked tf Henry, 
^etly—dhat normd useless impotent woman-worrying dmt Ae 

157 



ahsetit male — as to how he fared, if he were cold or hungry or not. 
Just as we talked of his father, as if hath they and we still lived in 
that time which that shot, those running mad feet, had put a period 
to and then obliterated, as though that afternoon had never been. 
But not once did we mention Charles Bon. There were two afier~ 
noons in the late fall when Judith was absent, returning at supper 
time serene and calm. I did not ask and I did not follow her, yet I 
knew and I kneiv that Clytie knew that she had gone to clear that 
grave of dead leaves and the sere brown refuse of the cedars — that 
mound vanishing slowly back into the earth, beneath which we had 
buried nothing. No, there had been no shot. That sound was merely 
the sharp and find clap-to of a door between us and all that was, all 
that might have been — a retroactive severance of the stream of 
event: a forever crystallized instant in imponderable time accom- 
plished by three weak yet indomitable women which, preceding the 
accomplished fact which we declined, refused, robbed the brother of 
the prey, rft the murderer of a vidimfor his very bullet. That was 
how we lived for seven months. And then one ajiemoon in January 
Tlwmas Sutpen came home; someone looked up where we were 
preparing the garden for another year s food and saw him riding 
up the drive. And then one evening I became engaged to marry him. 

It took me Just three months. (Do you mind that I dont say he, 
hut I?) Yes, I, Just three months, who for twenty years had looked 
on him (when I did— had to too — look) as an ogre, some beast out 
of a tale to frighten children with; who had seen his own get upon 
my dead sisters body already begin to destroy one another, yet who 
must come to him like a whistled dog at that Jirst opportunity, that 
noon when he who had been seeing me for twettiy years shouU first 
raise his head and pause and look at me. Oh, I hold no brief for 
myself who could (and would; ay, doubtless have already) give 
you a thousand specious reasons good enough for women, ran^ng 
jrom woman*s natural inconsistency to the_ desire (or even hope) 
for posable wedtk, poation, or even the fear of dying, mcmless 
158 



which {so they will doubtless tell you) old maids always have, or 
Jor revenge. No. I hold no brief for me. I could have gone home 
atd I did not. Perhaps I should have gone home. But I did not. As 
Judith and Clytie did, I stood there before the rotting portico and 
watched him ride up on that gaunt and jaded horse on which he did 
not seem to sit but rather seemed to project himself ahead like a- 
mirage, in some fierce dynamic rigidity of impatience which the 
gaunt horse, the saddle, the boots, the leaf-colored and threadbare 
coat with its tarnished and flapping braid containing the sentient 
though nerveless shell, which seemed to precede him as he dis- 
mounted and out of which he said ‘ Well, daughter’ and stooped and 
touched his beard to Judith’s forehead, who had not, did not, move, 
who stood rigid and still and immobile of face, and within which 
they spoke four sentences, four sentences of simple direct words be- 
hind beneath above which I felt that same rapport of communal 
blood which I had sensed that day while Clytie held me from the 

stairs: ^Henry’s not ?’ ‘No. He’snothere.’ — ‘Ah. And ?’ 

‘Yes. Henry killed him.* And then burst into tears. Yes, burst, who 
had not wept yet, who had brought down the stairs that afternoon 
and worn ever since that cold, calm face which had stopped me in 
midrunning at that closed door; yes, burst, as if that entire accumu- 
lation of seven months were erupting spontaneously from every 
pore in one incredible evacuation {she not moving, not moving a 
muscle) and then vanishing, disappearing as instantaneously as if 
die very fierce and arid aura whudi he had enclosed her in were dry- 
ing the tears faster than they emerged: and still standing with his 
hands on her shoulders and looked a Clytie and said, ‘Ah, Clytie* 
and then at me — the same face which I had last seen, only a little 
thinner, the same ruthless eyes, the hdr grizzled a litde now, and 
no recognition in the face at dl until Juditit said, ‘It’s Rjosa. Aunt 
Rosa. She lives here now.’ 

That was dll. He rode up the drive and into our lives agmn and 
lefi no ripple save those instantaneous and inaedihle tears. Bamse 

tS9 



he himself was net there, not in the house where we spent our days, 
had not stopped there. The shell of him was there, using the room 
which we had kept for him and eating the food which we produced 
and prepared as if it could neither feel the softness of the bed nor 
make distinction between the viands either as to quality or taste. 
Yes. He wasn’t there. Something ate with us; we talked to it and 
it answered ipiestions; it sat with us before the fire at night and, 
rousing without any warning from some profound and bemused 
complete inertia, talked, not to us, the six ears, the three minds 
capable of listening, hut to the air, the waiting grim decaying pres- 
ence, spirit, of the house itself, talking that which sounded like the 
bombast of a madman who aeates within his very coffin walls his 
fabulous immeasurable Camelots and CariUsssonnes. Not absent 
from the place, the arbitrary square of earth which he had named 
Sutpen’s Hundred: not that at all. He was absent only from the 
room, and that because her had to be elsewhere, a part of him en- 
compassing each ruined field and fallen fence and crunAling wall 
of cabin or cotton house or crib; himself diffused and in solution held 
by that electric Jurious immobile urgency and awareness of short 
time and the need for haste as if he had Just drawn breath and looked 
about and realized that he was old {he was fifty-nine) and was 
concerned {not afraid: concerned) not that old age might have I ft 
him impotent to do what he intended to do, but that he might not 
have time to do it in before he would have to die. We were right 
about what he would intend to do: that he would not even pause 
for breath before undertaking to restore his house and planteOion as 
near as possible to what it had been. We did not Imow how he 
would go about it, nor I believe did he. He could not have known, 
who came home with nothing, to nothing, to four years less than 
nothing. But it did not stop him, intimidate him. His was that cold 
alert fury of the gambler who knows that he may lose anyway but 
that with a second’s flagffing of die fierce constant will he is sure 
to: and who ke^s suspense from ever quite crystallizing by shew 
160 



fierce manipuldim of the cards or dice until the ducts and glands 
of luck begin to flow again. He did not pause, did not tcike that day 
or two to let the bones and flesh offlfiy-nine recuperet — the day 
or two in which he might have talked, not about us and what we 
had been doing, hut about himself, the past four years {for dl he 
ever told us, there might not have been any war at all, or it on an- 
other planet and no stake of his risked on it, no flesh and blood of 
his to suffer by it) — that naturd period during which bitter thou^ 
unmaimed dffeat might have exhausted itself to something like 
peace, like &lt;ptiet in ike raging and maedulous recounting {which 
enables man to bear with living) of that feather's balance between 
victory and disaster which makes that defeat unbearable which, 
turning against him, yet declined to slay him who, still alive, yet 
cannot hear to live with it. 

We hardly ever saw him. He would begone from dawn utdl 
dark, he and Jones and another man or two that he had got from 
somewhere and paid with something, perhaps dte same coin in 
which he had paid that fordgn architect— c^olery, promise, dmat, 
and at last force. That was die winter when we began to learn what 
empet-bagger meant and people — women — lodied doors and win- 
dows at night and begem toflighkn each other with tales of ne^co 
uprisings, when the ruined, the four years’ fallow and n^keted 
land lay more idle yet while men with pistols in their pockets gah- 
ered daily at seaet meeting places in the towns. He did not nudie 
one of dwse; I remember how one nigh a deputation catted, rode 
out ^ough the mud cf early March and put him to the point &lt;f 
d^nite yes or no, with thm or againa them,flimd or enemy: and 
he refused, declined, offered them {with no change of gaunt ruthless 
face nor level voice) d^ance if it was dfflaace they wankd, tetting

lamp above his head while their spokesman delivemd his ultima- 
tum: ‘This may be war, Sufpen* and answered, ‘I am used to it' 
Oh yeSj I watched him, watched his old man's solitary fury fight- 
ing now not with the stubborn yet slowly tractable earth as it had 
done before, hut now against the ponderable weight of the changed 
new time itself as though he were trying to dam a river with his 
bare hands and a shingle: and this for the same spurious delusion 
of reward which had failed (failed? betrayed: and would this time 
destroy) him once; I see the analogy myself now: the accelerating 
drcle’s fatal curving course of his ruthless pride, his lust for vain 
magnificence, though I did not then. And how could I? turned 
twenty true enough yet still a child, still living in that womb-like 
corridor where the world came not even as living echo but as dead 
incomprehensible shadow, where with the quiet and unalarmed 
amazement of a child I watched the miragy antics of men and 
women — my father, my sister, Thomas Sutpen, Judith, Henry, 
Charles Bon — called honor, principle, marriage, love, bereave- 
ment, death; the child who watching him was not a child but erne of 
that triumvirate mother-woman which we three, Judith, Clyde and 
I, made, which fed and clothed and warmed the static shell and so 
gave vent and scope to the fierce vain illusion and so said, ‘At last 
my life is worth something, even though it only shields and guards 
the antic Jury of an insane child' And then one eftemoon (I was in 
the garden with a hoe, where the path came up from the stable lot) 
I looked up and saw him looking at me. He had seen me for twenty 
years, but now he was looking at me; he stood there in the path 
looking at me, in the middle of the afternoon. That was it: thst it 
should have been in the middle of the rfiemoon, when he shotM not 
have been anywhere near the house at all but miles away and in- 
visible somewhere among his hundred square miles which they had 
not troubled to begin to take away from him yet, perhaps not even 



but enlarged, magnified, encompassing as though in a prolonged 
and unbroken instant of tremendous effort embracing and holding 
intact that ten-mile square while he faced from the brink of disaster, 
invincible and unafraid, what he must have known would he the 
final defeta) but instead of that standing there in the path looking 
at me with something airbus and strange in his face as if the ham- 
lot, the path at the instant when he came in sight of me had been a 
swamp out of which he had emerged without having been fore- 
warned that he was about to enter light, and then went on— -the 
face, the same face: it was not love; I do not say that, not gentleness 
or pity: just a sudden over-burst of light, illumination, who had 
been told that his son had done murder and vanished and said ‘Ah. 

. — Well, Clyde j He went on to the house. But it was not love: I 
do not claim that; I hold no brief for myself, I do not excuse it. I 
could have said that he had ne^d, used me; why should I rebel 
now, because he would use me more? but I did not say it; I could 
say this time, I do not know, and I would tell the truth. Because I 
do not know. He was gone; I did not even know that eidm since 
there is a metabolism of the spirit as well as of the entrails, in whidi 
the stored accumulations of long time burn, generate, create and 
break some maidenhead cf the ravening meat; ay, in a xcond's 
time— yes, lost all the shibboleth erupting ofcarmot, will not, never 
will in one red instant’s fierce obliteration. This was my inXant, 
who could have fled then and did not, who found thM he hadgotm 
on and did not remember when he had walked away, who found 
my okra bed finished without remembering the completing &lt;f U, 
who sat (U the supper table that night with the familiar dream- 
doudy shell which we had grown used to {he did not look at me 
again during die med; I might have said then, To what deluded 
sewer-gush of dreaming does dw incorrigible flesh betray us: but I 
did not) and then before the fire in Judith’s bedroom sat as we dr- 
ways did until he came in the door and looked at us and sedd, fu- 

Mth, you and Clyde ’ and ceased, sdU entering, dmsdd, ‘No,

never mind. Ross will mt mind if you both hear it too, since we 
are short for time and busy with what we have of id and came and 
stopped and put his hand on my head and (I do not know what he 
looked at while he spoke, save that by the sound of his voice it was 
not at us nor at anything in that room) said, ‘You may think I 
made your sister Ellen no very good husband. You probably do 
diink so. Bid even if you will not discount the fact that I am older 
now, I believe I can promise that I shall do no worse at least for 
youd 

That was my amrtship. That minute’s exchanged look*m a 
kitdten garden, that hand upon my head in his daughter s bedroom; 
a tdme, a deaee, a serene and florid boast like a sentence {ay, and 
delivered in the same attitude) not to be spoken and heard but to be 
read carved in the bland stone which pediments a forgotten and 
tameless effigy. I do not excuse it. I claim no brief, no pity, who 
did not answer T wiW not because I was not asked, because there 
was noplace, no niche, no interval for reply. Because I could have 
made one. I could have forced thcd niche myself if I had willed to — 
a niche not shewed to fit mild ‘Yes’ but some blind desperate female 
weepons frenzied slash whose very gaping wound had cried ‘Not 
Nor and ‘Help!’ and ‘Save met’ No, no brief, no pity, who did 
not even move, who sat beneath that hard oblivious childhood (^re’s 
hand and heard him speak to Judith now, heard Judith’s feet, saw 
Judidi’s hwd, not Judith — that palm in which I read as from a 
printed dtrionuie li« orphaning, the hardship, the bereave of love; 
theflmr hard barren years of scoriating loom, of axe and hoe and 
all die other tools deaeedfor men to use: and upon it lying the ring 
which he gave Ellen in the church almost thirty years ago. Yes, 
anahgy and paradox and madness too. I sat there and felt, not 
watched, him slip die ring onto my. filler in my turn (he was sit- 
ting now (iso, in dw chair which we called Clyde’s while she stood 
Just beyond die firelight’s range beside dx chimney) and listened to 
Ms voke as Men must have listened in her own spirit’s April thirty 



years ago: he talking not about me or hue or marriage, not even 
about himself and to no sane mortal listening nor out of any sanity, 
hut to the very dark forces of fate tuhieh he had evoked and dared, 
out of that wild braggart dream where an intact Sutpens Hundred 
which no more had actual being now (and would never have again) 
than it had when Ellen first heard it, as though in the restoration 
of that ring to a living finger he had turned all time bade twenty 
years and stopped it, froze it. Yes. I sat tkre and listened to his 
voice and told myself, ‘Why, he is mad. He will decree this mar- 
riage for tonight and pc farm his own ceremony, himself both groom 
and minister; pronounce his own ivild benediction on it with the 
very bedward candle in his hand: and I mad too, for I will acqui- 
esce, succumb; abet him and plunge downd No, I hold no brief, ask 
no pity. If I was saved that night (and I was saved; mine was to be 
some later, colder saaifice when we— I— should be free of all ex- 
cuse of the surprised importunate traitorous fiesh) it was no fault, 
no doing of my own but rather because, once he had restored the 
ring, he ceased to look at me save as Ite had looked for the twenty 
years before that afternoon, as if he had reached for the moment 
some interval of sanity such as the mad know, just as the sane have 
intervals of madness to keep tltem aware that they are sane. It teas 
more than that even. For thee months now he had seen me daily 
though he had not looked at me since I merely made one of that tri- 
umvirate who received his gruff unspoken mansgratitt^ for tlte 
spartan ease we supplied, not to his comfort perhaps but at least to 
the mad dream he lived in. But for the next two months he dtd not 
even see me. Perhaps the reason was the obvious one: he tvas too 
busy; that having accomplished his atgagement (granted that was 
what he wanted) he did not need to see me. Certainly he did ndU 
there was' not even any date set for the wedding. It was almost as 
though that very afternoon did not exist, had never happened. I 
might not have even been there in the house. Worse: I couU have 
gone, returned home, and h would not have missed me. I was 

Ids 



{whatever it was he wanted of me — not my being, my presence: 
just my existence, whatever it was that Rosa Coldfield or any 
young female no blood kin to him represented in whatever it was 
he wanted — because I will do him Ais credit: he had never once 
thought about what he asked me to do until the motnent he asked 
it because I know that he would not have waited two months or 
even two days to ask it) — my presence was to him only the absence 
^ black morass and snarled vine and creeper to that man who had 
Juggled through a swamp with nothing to guide or drive him — 
no hope, no light: only some incorrigibility of undefeat — and blund- 
ered at last and without warning onto dry solid ground and sun and 
air— -if there could have been such thing as sun to him, if anyone or 
anything could have competed with the white glare of his madness. 
Yes, mad, yet not so mad. Because there is a practicality to vicious- 
ness: the thief, the liar, the murderer even, has faster rules than 
virtue ever has; why not madness too? If he was mad, it was only 
his compelling dream which was insane and not his methods: it was 
no madman who bargained and cajoled hard manual labor out of 
men like Jones; it was no madman who kept clear of the sheets and 
hoods and night-galloping horses with which men who were once 
his acqudntances even if not hisfnends discharged the canker sup- 
puration of dfeat; it was no madman’s plan or tactics which gained 
him at the lowest possible price the sole woman available to wive 
him, and by the one device which could have gained his point — not 
madman, no: since surely there is something in madness, even the 
demoniac, which Satan flees, aghast at his own handiwork, and 
which God looks on in pity — some spark, some crumb to leaven 
and redeem that articulated flesh, that speech sight hearing taste 
and being which we call human man. But no matter. I will tell you 
jwhat he did and let you he the judge. {Or try to tell you, because 
dtere are some things for which three words are three too many, and 
three thousand words that many words too less, and this is one of 
them. Bean he told; I could tedte then many sentences, repeat the 
l66 



bold blank naked and outrageous words just as he spoke them, and 
bequeath you only that same aghast and outraged unbelief I htew 
when I comprehended what he meant; or take three thousand sen- 
tences and leave you only that Why? Why? and Why? that I 
have asked and listened to for almost ffiy years.) But I will let you 
he the judge and let you tell me if I was not right. 

You see, I ivas that sun, or thought I was who did believe there 
was that spark, that crumb in madness which is divine, thotigh 
madness know no word itself for terror or for pity. There was an 
ogre of my childhood which bfore my birth removed my only sister 
to its grim ogre-houme and produced two half phantom children 
whom I was not encouraged, and did not desire, to associate with 
as if my late-born solitude had taught me presentimetit of that fate- 
ful intertwining, warned me of that fatal snarly climax before I 
knew the name for murder — and I forgave it; there ivas a shape 
which rode away beneath a flag and {demon or no) courageously 
suffered— and I did more than just forgive: I sletv it, because the 
body, the blood, the memory which that ogre had dwelt in returned 
five years later and held out its hand and said ‘Come* as you might 
say it to a dog, and I came. Yes, the body, die face, unth the right 
name and memory, even the correct remembering of what and 
whom {except myself: and was that not hut further proof?) it had 
left behind and returned to: but not tlte ogre; villain true enough, 
hut a mortal fallible one less to invoke fear than pity: but no ogre; 
mad true enough, but I told myself. Why should not madness be 
its own victim also? or. Why may it be not even madness but soli- 
tary despair in titan conflict with the lonely and foredoomed and 
indomitable iron spirit: but no ogre, because it was dead, vanished, 
consumed somewhere inflame and sulphur-reek perhaps among the 
lonely crc^y peaks of my childhood’s solitary remembering — or 
forgetting; I was that sun, who believed that he {after thU evening 
injudith*s room) was not oblivious of me hut only umonsdous and 
receptive like the swamp-freed pilgrim feeling cartel and ta^ng sun 

I&lt;S7 



md light again and aware of neither hut only of darkness^ and 
morass^ look — toho did believe there was that magic in tmkin 
blood which we call by the pallid name of love that ivould be, 
might be sun for him (though I the youngest, weahest) where Ju^ 
dith and Clytie both would cast no shadow; yes, I the youngest 
there yet potently without tneasured and measurable age since I 
alone of them could say, furious mad old man, I hold no sub^ 
stance that will ft your dream but I can give you airy space and 
scope for your delirium.* And then one afternoon — oh there was a 
fate in it: afternoon and afternoon and afternoon: do you see? the 
death of hope and love, the death of pride and principle, and then 
the death of everything save the old outraged and aghast mbelkv-- 
ing which has lasted for forty-tkee years — he returned to the house 
and called me, shouting from the hack gallery until I came down; 
oh I told you he had not thought of it until that moment, that pren 
longed moment which contained the distance between the house and 
wherever it was he had been standing when he thought of it: and 
this too coincident: it was the very day on which he knew definitely 
and at last exactly how much of his hundred square miles he would 
be able to save and keep and call his own on the day when he 
would have to die, that no matter what happened to him now, he 
would at least retain the shell of Sutpens Hundred even though a 
better name for it would now be Sutpens One — called, shouted for 
me until 1 came dawn. He had not even waited to tether his horse; 
he stood with the reins over his arm (and no hand on my head now) 
and spake the bald outrageous tvords exactly as if he were consult-- 
ing with Jones or with some other man about a bitch dog or a cow 
or mare. 

They will have told you how I came back heme. Oh yes, I 
know: *Ro$ie Col^eld, lose him, weep him; caught a man but 
couldnt keep him* — Oh yes, I know (and kind too; they would 
he kind): Rosa Coldfield, warped bitter orphaned country stick 
mllei Rosa Col^eld, s^ety engaged at last and so off thejown,

file county; they will have told you: How I went out there to live 
for the rest of my life, seeing in my nepheu^s murdering an act of 
Cod enahling me ostensibly to obey my dying sisters request that 
I save at least one of the two childrm which she had doomed by 
conceiving them but actually to be in the house when he returned 
who, being a demon, would therfbre be impervious to shot and 
shell and so would return; I waiting for him because I was young 
still {ivho had buried no hopes to bugles, beneath a flag) and ripe 
for marrying in this time and place where most of the young men 
were dead and all the living ones either old or cdready married or 
tired, too tired for love; he my best, my only chance in this: an en- 
vironment where at best and even lacking war my chances would 
have been slender enough since I was not only a Southern gentle- 
woman but the very modest character of whose background and 
circumstances must needs be their own affirmation since had 1 been 
the daughter of a wedthy planter I could have married almost any- 
one but being the daughter merely of a smdl store-keeper I could 
even afford to acceptfiowersfiom almost no one and so would have 
been doomed to marry at last some casual apprentke-clerk in my 
fatker*s husiness—Yes, they will have told you: who was young 
and had buried hopes only during that night which was four years 
long when beside a shuttered and unsleeping candle she embalmed 
the War and its Iwritage of suffering and injustice and sorrow on 
the backsides of the pages within an old account book, emhdming 
blotting from the breathable air die poisonous secret effluvium of 
lusting and haring and killing — they will have told you: daughter 
of an embusque tvho had to turn to a demon, a villain: and there- 
fore she had been right in haring her father since if he had not died 
in that etttic she would not have had to go out there to find food and 
protection and shelter and if die had not had to depend on his food 
and clothing (even if she did help to grow and weave it) to keep 
her alive and warm, until simple justice demanded that she mcdee 
what return for it Ite might require of her commmurate w^h hma, 

i6q 



she would not have become engaged to him and if she had not be- 
ame engaged to him she would not have had to tie at night asking 
herself Why and Why and Why as she has done for forty-three 
years: as if she had been instinctively right even as a child in hating 
her father and so these forty-three years of impotent and unbearable 
outrage were the revenge on her of some sophisticated and ironic 
sterile nature for having hated that which gave her life. — Yes, Rosa 
Coldfield engaged at last who, lacking the fact that her sister had 
bequeathed her at least something of shelter and Mn, might have be- 
come a charge upon the town: and now Rosie Col^ld, lose him, 
weep him; found a man but failed to keep him; Rosa Col^ld who 
would be right, only being right is not enough for women, who had 
rather be wrong than just that; who want the man who was wrong 
to admit it. And that’s what she cant forgive him for: not for the 
insult, not even for having Jilted him: but for being dead. Oh ya, 
I blow, I know: How two months later they learned that she had 
padeed up her belongings {that is, put on the shawl and hat again) 
and come back to town, to live alone in the house where her parents 
were dead and gone and where Judith would come now ani then 
and bring her some of what food they had out at Sutpen’s Hundred 
and which only dire necessity, the brute inexplkabk flesh’s stub- 
born tvill to live, brought ^ {Miss Coldfield) to aaxpt. And it 
dke indeed: because now the toivit— farmers passing, negro serv- 
ants going to work in white kitchens — would see her before sun-up 
gathering geens dor^ garden fences, pulling diem through tlx fence 
since she had no garden of her own, no seed to plant one with, no 
tools to work it with herself, even if she had known aimpletely 
how, who had had only the freshman year at gardening and doubt- 
less would not have worked it if she had knoum; reathing durough 
die garden fence and gathering vegetdbles dun^h she wotdd have 
been welcome to enter the garden and get diem, mid diey wordd 
have even done the gathering and sent them to her, since tho’e were 
trme people dim Judge Benbow who would leave badtets ofpro- 
vmcms on her front pordt at nigh. But dm would not permit them 



and would not even use a stick to reach throttgh the fettce md draw 
the vegetables to tvhere she could grasp them, the reach of her un- 
aided arm being the limit of brigandage which she never passed. It 
was not to keep from being seen stealing that sent her forth before 
the toivn was awake, because if she had had a nigger she would 
have sent him forth in broad daylight to forage, where, she wotdi 
not have cared, exactly as the cavalry heroes ivhom she wrote verse 
about would have sent their men. — Yes, Rosie Coldfield, lose him, 
weep him; caught a beau but cotddnt keep him; (ph yes, they will 
tell you) found a beau and was insulted, something heard and not 
forgiven, not so much for the saying of it but for having thouglU 
it about her so that when she heard it she realized like thunderclap 
that it must have been in his mind for a day, a week, even a month 
maybe, he looking at her daily with that in his mind and she not 
even knowing it. But I forgave him. They will tell you different, 
but I did. Why shouldn’t I? I had nothing to forgive; I had not 
lost him because I never omied him: a certain segment of rotten 
mud walked into my life, spoke that to me which I had never hetmd 
before and never shall again, and then walked out; that was dl. I 
never owned him; certainly not in that sewer sense which you 
would mean by that and maybe think {but you are mong) I mean. 
That did not matter. That was not even the nub of the in&amp;dt. I 
mean that he was not owned by anyone or anything in this world, 
had never been, would never be, not even by Ellen, not even by 
Jones’ granddaughter. Because he was not artiadated in this world. 
He was a walking shadow. He was the light-blinded bat-like 
image of his own torment cast by the fierce demoniac lantern up 
from beneath the earth’s crust and hence in retrograde, reverse; from 
abysmal and chaotic dark to eternal and diysmal dark completing 
his descending {do you mark the gradation?) ellipsis, clinging, try- 
ing to cling with vain unsubstantial hands to whti he hoped would 
hold him, save him, arrest him — Ellen {do you mark them?), my- 
self, then last of dl that fidherless daughter of Wash Jones* only 
child who, so I heard once, died in a Memphis brothel— to jini 

171 



scverefux (even if not rest and peace) at last in the stroke of a rusty 
scythe. I was told, informed of that too, though not by Jones this 
time but by someone else kind enough to turn aside and tell me he 
ivas dead. ‘Dead?’ I cried. ‘Dead? You? You lie; you’re not dead; 
heaven cannot, and hell dare not, have you!’ But Quentin was 
not listening, because tbere was also something which he too 
could not pass — ^that door, the running feet on the stairs be- 
yond it almost a continuation of die faint shot, the two 
women, the negress and the white girl in her underthings 
(made of flour sacking when there had been flour, of win- 
dow curtains when not) pausing, lookup at the door, the 
yellowed creamy mass of old intricate satin and lace spread 
carefully on the bed and then caught swifdy up by the white 
gjrl and held before her as the door aashed in and the brother 
stood there, hadess, with his shaggy bayonet-trimmed hair, 
his gaunt worn unshaven face, his patched and faded gray 
tunic, the pistol still hanging against his flank: the two of 
them, brodier and sister, curiously alike as if the difierence 
in sex had merely sharpened the common blood to a terrific, 
an almost unbearable, similarity, speaking to one another in 
short brief staccato sentences like slaps, as if they stood breast 
to breast striking one another in turn neither making any 
attempt to guard against the blows. 

Now you cant marry him. 

Why cant I marry him? 

Because he’s dead. 

Dead? 

Yes. I killed him. 

He (Quentin) couldn’t pass that. He was not even listening 
to her; he said, “Ma’amj What’s that? What did you sayj” 

“There’s something in that house.” 

“In that houses It’s Clyde. Dont she ” 

. “No. Something living in it. Hidden in it It has been out 
ihere for four yeas, living hidden in that house.”

* VI * 


There was snow on Shrcvc’s overcoat sleeve, liis un- 
gloved blond square hand red and raw witla cold, vanishing. 
Then on the table before Quentin, lying on the open text 
book beneath the lamp, the white oblong of envelope, the 
familiar blurred mechanical Jefferson Jatt to 1910 Miss and 
then, opened, the My dear son in his father’s sloped fine hand 
out of that dead dusty summer where he had prepared fisr 
Harvard so that his fadier’s hand could lie on a strange lamp- 
lit table in Cambridge; that dead summer twilight — ^thc wis- 
taria, the cigar-smell, the fireflies — attenuated up from Mis- 
sissippi and into this strange room, across this strange iron 
New England snow: 

My dear son, 

Miss Rosa Coldjield was huried yesterday. She remained in die 
coma for almost two weeks and two days ago she died without re~ 
gaining consciousness and without pain dtey say, and whenever 
they mean by that sittce it has always seemed to ate that the only 
painless deruh must be that which t^es the intelligence by violent 
surprise and from the rear so to spedt, since if death be anything at 
all beyond a briff and peculiar etnotional state of the bereaved it 
must be a brief and liketvise peculiar state of the subject as well. 
And if aught can be more painful to any intelligence above that of 
a child or at idiot than a slow and gradual confronting with that 
which over a long period of bewilderment and dread it has been 
taught to regard as an irrevocable and unplumbablc finality, I do 

173 



mt htow it. Aitd if there can be either access of comfort or cessation 
tf pain in the ultimate escape from a stubborn and amazed outrage 
which over a period of forty-three years has been companionship 
and bread and fire and all, I do not hnoiv that either 

the letter bringing with it that very September evening 

itself (and he soon needing, required, to say “No, neither aunt, 
cousin, nor uncle, Rosa. Miss Rosa Coldfield, an old lady 
that died young of outrage in 1866 one summer” and then 
Shieve said, “You mean she was no kin to you, no kin to you 
at all, that there was actually one Southern Bayard or Guine- 
vere who was no kin to you? then what did she die for;” 
and that not Shreve’s first time, nobody’s first time in Cam- 
bridge since September: Tell about the South. What’s it like 
there. What do they do there. Why do they live there. Why do 
they live at all) — ^that very September evening when Mr 
Compson stopped talking at last, he (Quentin) walked out 
of his Other’s talking at last because it was now time to go, 
not because he had heard it all because he had not been listen- 
hig, since he had something which he still was unable to pass: 
that door, that gaunt tragic dramatic selfihypnotized youth- 
ful face like the tragedian in a college play, an academic 
Hamlet waked from some trancement of the curtain’s falling 
and blundering across the dusty st^e from which the rest of 
the cast had departed last Commencement, the sister facing 
him across the wedding dress which she was not to use, not 
even to finish, the two of them slashing at one another with 
twelve or fourteen words and most of these the same words 
repeated two or three times so that when you boded it down

And she (Miss Coldfield) had on the shawl, as he had 
known she would, and the bonnet (black once but faded now

not to go, to turn back notif and let what is, be; he (Quentin) 
agreeing to this, sitting in the buggy beside the implacable 
doll-sized old woman clutching her cotton umbrella, smell- 
ing the heat-distiUed old woman-flesh, the heat-distilled 
camphor in the old fold-creases of the shawl, feeling exactly 
like an electric bulb, blood and skin, since the buggy dis-

Good Lord yes, let's dont find him or it, try to find him or it, risk 
disturbing hint or it: (then Shreve again, “Wait. Wait. You 
mean that this old gal, this Aunt Rosa ” 

“Miss Rosa,” Quentin said. 

“All i%ht all right. — ^that this old dame, this Aunt Rosa — 

“Miss Rosa, I tell you.” 

“All right all right all right. — that this old — this Aunt 

R All right all right all right all right. that hadn’t 

been out there, hadn’t set foot in the house even in forty- 
three years, yet who not only said there was somebody hid- 
den in it but found somebody that would believe her, would 
drive that twelve miles out dhere in a buggy at midnight to 
see if she was right or not?” 

“Yes,” Quentin said. 

“That this old dame that grew up in a household like an 
overpopulated mausoleum, with no call or claim on her rime 
but the hating of her father and aunt and her sister’s husband 
in peace and comfort and waiting for the day when they 
would prove not only to themselves but to everybody else 
that she had been right. So one night the aunt slid down the 
rainpipe with a horse trader, and she was right about the 
aunt so that fixed that: then her father nailed himself up in 
the attic to keep from being drafted into the Rebel army and 
Carved to death, so that fixed that except for the unavoidable 
possibility that when the moment came for him to admit to 

17&lt;S 



himself thac she had been right he itiay not have been able 
to speak or may not have had anyone to tell it to: so she was 
right about the father too, since if he hadn’t made General 
Lee and Jeff Davis mad he wouldn’t have had to nail himself 
up and die and if he hadn’t died he wouldn’t have left her an 
orphan and a pauper and so situated, left suscepnble to a situ- 
ation v/here she could receive this mortal affront: and right 
about the brother-in-law because if he hadn’t been a demon 
his cliildren wouldn’t have needed protection from him and 
she wouldn’t have had to go out there and be betrayed by 
the old meat and find instead of a widowed Agamemnon to 
her Cassandra an ancient stiffjointed Pyramus to her eager 
diough untried Thisbe who could approach her in this un- 
bidden April’s compounded demonry and suggest that dicy 
breed together for test and sample and if it was a boy they 
would marry; would not have had to be blown back to 
town on the initiai blast of that horror and outrage to eat of 
gall and wormwood stolen through paling fences at dawn. 
So this was not fixed at all and forever because she couldn’t 
even teU it because of who her successor was, not because he 
found a successor by just turning around, and no day’s loss 
of time even, but because of who the successor was, that she 
might conceivably have ever suflfered a situation where she 
coidd or would have to decline any office which her successor 
could have been deemed worthy, even by a demon, to fill; 
this not fixed at all since when the moment came for him to 
admit he had been wrong she would have the same troubk 
with him she had with her father, he would be dead too 
siurp Ae doubtless foresaw the scythe if for no other reason 
than that it would be the final outrage and affiront like the 
Tiammer and nails in her father’s business — ^that scythe, sytn- 
bolic laurel of a caesar’s triumphr— that rusty scythe loaned 
by the demon hims elf tx&gt; Jones more than two years ago to 

177 



cut tJifi weeds away from the shanty doorway to smooth 
die path for rutting — that rusty blade garlanded widh each 
successive day’s gaudy ribbon or cheap bead for the 0iow 
did she put it? slut wasn’t all, was it?) to walk in — that scythe 
beyond whose symbolic shape he, even though dead, even 
when earth itself declined any longer to bear his weight, 
jeered at her?” 

“Yra,” Quentin said. 

“That this Faustus, this demon, this Beelzebub fled hiding 
fiom some momentary flashy glare of his Creditor’s outraged 
fece exasperated beyond aE endurance, hiding, scuttling into 
respectability like a jackal into a rockpile, so she thought at 
first, until she realized that he was not hiding, did not want 
to hide, was merely engaged in one final frenzy of evil and 
harm-doing before the Creditor overtook him next time for 
good and all — this Faustus who appeared suddenly one Sun- 
day with two pistols and twenty subsidiary demons and 
skuHdugged a hundred miles of land out of a poor ignorant 
Indian and built the biggest house on it you ever saw and 
went away with six wagons and came back with the crystal 
tapestries and the Wedgwood chairs to furnish it and nobody 
knew if he had robbed another steamboat or had just dug 
up a liole more of the old loot, who hid horns and tail be- 
neath human raiment and a beaver hat and chose (bought 
her, outswapped his father-in-law, wasn’t it) a wife after 
three years to scrutinize, weigh and compare, not firom one 
of the local ducal houses but firom the lesser baronage whose 
principality was so far decayed that there would be no risk 
of his wife bringing him for dowry delusions of grandeur 
before he should be equipped for it, yet not so far decayed 
but that she might keep them both from getting lost among 
the new knives and forks and spoons that he had bought — a 
wife who not only would consolidate the hiding but could 

178 



would and did breed Iiini two children to fend and shield 
both in themselves and in dieir progeny the brittle bones and 
tired flesh of an old man against die day when the Creditor 
would run him to earth for the last time and he couldn’t get 
away: and so sure enough the daughter fell in love, die son 
the agent for the providing of that livmg bulwark between 
him (the demon) and the Creditor’s bailifF hand until the 
son should marry and thus insure him doubled and com- 
pounded — and then the demon must turn square around and 
run not only the fiance out of the house and not only the 
son out of the house but so corrupt, seduce and mesmerize 
the son that he (the son) should do the office of the outraged 
father’s pistol-hand when fornication threatened: so that the 
demon should return from the war five years later and find 
accomplished and complete the situation he had been work- 
ing for: son fled for good now with a noose behind him, 
daughter doomed to spinsterhood — and then almost befiiic 
his foot was out of the stirrup he (the demon) set out and 
got himself eng:^ed again in order to replace that progeny 
the hopes of whidi he h^ himself destroyed?” 

“Yes,” Quentin said. 

“Came back home and found his chances of descendants 
gone where his children had attended to that, and his plan- 
tation ruined, fields fallow except for a fine stand of weed^ 
and taxes and levies and penalties sowed by United Stales 
marshals and such and all his niggers gone where the Yan- 
kees had attended to that, and you would have thought he 
would have been satisfied: yet before his foot was out of the 
stirrup he not only set out to try to restore his plantadon to 
what it used to be, like maybe he was hoping to fool the 
Creditor by illusion and obfuscation by concealing behind 
the illusion that time had not elapsed and change occurred 
die Bet that he was now almost sixty years until he 



could get Hmself a new batdi of diildren. to bulwark him, 
but chose for this purpose the last woman on earth he might 

have hoped to prevail on, this Aunt R ^all right all right 

all right. — that hated him, that had always hated him, yet 
choosing her with a kind of outrageous bravado as if a kind 
of despairing conviction of his irresistibility or invulnerabil- 
ity were a part of the price he had got for whatever it was he 
had sold the Creditor, since according to the old dame he 
never had had a soul; proposed to her and was accepted — 
then three months later, with no date ever set for the wed- 
ding and marriage itself not mentioned one time since, and 
on die very day when he established definitely that he would 
be able to keep at least some of his land and how much, he 
approached her and suggested they breed a couple of dogs 
together, inventing with fiendish cunning the thing which 
husbands and fiances have been trying to invent for ten mil- 
lion years: the thing that without harming her or giving her 
grounds for civil or tnbal action would not only blast the 
little dream-woman out of the dovecote but leave her irre- 
vocably husbanded (and himself, husband or fiance, already 
safely cuckolded before she can draw breath) with the ab- 
stract carcass of outrage and revenge. He said it and was free 
now, forever more now of threat or meddling fiom anyone 
since he had at last eliminated the last member of his late 
wife’s family, free now: son fled to Texas or California or 
maybe even South America, daughter doomed to spinster- 
hood to live until he died, since after that it wouldn’t matter, 
m that rotting house, caring for him and feeding him, r aising 
chickens and peddling the eggs for the clothes she and Clyde 
couldn’t make: so that he didn’t even need to be a demon 
now but just mad impotent old man who had realized at 
last that hh dream of restoring his Sutpen’s Hummed was not 
only vain but that what he had left of it would never support 
I So 



Jum and his family and so runnLig his little crossroads store 
■with a stock of plowshares and hamc strings and calico and 
kerosene and cheap beads and ribbons and a clientele of 
freed niggers and (what is it? the word’ white wlut? — Yes, 
trash) with Jones for clerk and who knows maybe what de- 
lusions of making money out of the store to rebuild the 
plantation; who had escaped twice now, got himself into it 
and been freed by the Creditor who set his children to de- 
stroying one another before he had posterity, and he decided 
that maybe he was ■wrong in being free and so got into it 
again and then decided diat he w'as wrong in being unfree 
and so got out of it again — ^and then turned right around and 
bought his way back into it "with beads and calico and striped 
candy out of his own showcase and off his shelves;” 

“Yes,” Quentin said. He sounds just like father he thought, 
glancing (his face quiet, reposed, curiously almost sullen) for 
a moment at Shreve leaning forward into the lamp, his 
naked torso pink-gleaming and baby-smooth, cherubic, al- 
most hairless, the twin moons of his spectacles glinting 
against his moonhke rubicund face, smelling (Quentin) the 
cigar and the wistaria, seeing the fireflies blowing and •wink- 
ing in the September dusk. Jwsf exadly like faher if father hai

dottdy swirl of chickens while Jones was building the coffin and 
which she wore during the next year while the aunt lived there and 
the three women wove their own garments and raised their own 
food and cut the wood they cooked it with (excusing what help 
they had from Jones who lived with his granddaughter in the aban- 
doned fishing camp with its collapsing roof and rotting porch against 
whidi the rusty scythe which Sutpen was to lend him, make him 
borrow to cut away the weeds from the door — and at last forced him 
to use though not to cut weeds, at least not vegetable weeds — would 
lean for two years) and wore still after the aunt’s indignation had 
swept her hack to town to live on stolen garden truck and out of 
anonymous baskets left on her front steps at night, the three of

Faustus fling his final main notv with tJte Creditor’s hand already 
on his shoulder, running his little country store now for his bread 
and meat, haggling tediously over nickels and dimes with rapacious 
and poverty-stricken whites and negroes, who at one time could 
lutve galloped for ten miles in any direction without aossing his 
own boundary, using out of his meager stork die cheap ribbons and 
beads and the stale violently-colored candy with which even an old 
xBz 



f/ws can seduce a Jifieen-year-old country girt, to ruin the gr aid- 
daughter of his partner, this Jones — this gangling malaria-ridden 
white mat whom he had given permission fourteen years ago to 
squat in the abandoned f siting camp with the year old grandchild 
—Jones, partner porter and clerk who at the demons command re- 
moved with his own hand {and maybe delivered too) from the 
showcase the candy beads and ribbons, measured the very cloth 
from which Judith {who had not beat bereaved and did not mourn) 
helped the granddaughter to fashion a dress to walk past the loung- 
ing men in, the side-looking and the tongues, imtil her increasing 
belly taught her embarrassment — or perhaps fear—Jones who be- 
fore '6i had not even been allowed to approach the front of the 
house and who during the next four years got no nearer than the 
kitchai door and that only when he brought the game and fish and 
vegetables on which the seducer-to-be’s wife and daughter {and 
Clytie too, the one remaining servant, negro, the one ivho would 
forbid hint to pass the kitchen door with what he brought) depended 
on to keep life in them, but who now entered the house itself on the 
{quite frequent now) afternoons when the demon would suddenly 
curse the store empty of customers and lock the door and repair to 
the rear and in the same tone in which he used to address his orderly 
or even his house servants when he had them {and in which he 
dotditless ordered Jones to fetch from ^e showcase the ribbons mtd 
beads and candy) direct Jones to fetch the Jug, the two of them {and 
Jones even sitting noiv who in the old days, the old dead Sunday 
afternoons of monotonous peace which they spent beneath the scup- 
pentong arbor in the back yard, the demon tying in the hammock 
while Jones squatted against a post, rising fiom time to time to pour 
for the demon from the demijohn aid the bucket of spring water

would rise, stmying and plunging and shouting for his horse and 
pistols to ride single-handed into Washington and shoot Lincoln 
(a year or so too late here) and Sherman both, shouting, ‘Kill 
them! Shoot them down like the dogs they are!’ and Jones: ‘Sho,

open for him to enter with no change, no alteration in that calm 
frozen face which she had worn for four years now, and on up the 
stairs and into the bedroom and put him to bed like a baby and 
dten lie down himself on the floor beside the bed though not to sleep 
since before dawn the man on the bed would stir and groan and 
Jones would say, ‘Hyer I am. Kernel. Hit's all right. They aint 
whupped us yit, air they?’ — this Jones who after the demon rode 
away with the regiment when the granddaughter was only eight 
years old would tell people that he ‘was lookin after Majors place 
and niggers’ even before they had time to ask him why he tvas not 
with the troops and perhaps in time came to believe the lie himself, 
who was among the first to greet the demon when he returned, to 
meet him at the gate and say, ‘Well, Kernel, they kilt us but they 
aint whupped us yit, air they?* who even worked, labored, sweat 
at the demon’s behest during that first furious period while the 
demon believed he could restore by sheer indomitable willing the 
Sutpens Hundred which he remembered and had lost, l^ored

demon did {or would admit it) that the task was hopeless — blind 
Jones who apparently saw still in that furious ledterous wreck dte 
old fine figure of the man who once galloped on the blade thorough- 
in^ about that domain two boundaries of which the eye could not 
see from any point 
184 



“Yes,” Quentin said. 

So that Sunday morning came and the demon up and aivay be- 
fore dawn, Judith thinking she knew why sitwe that moniing the 
black stallion which he rode to Virginia and led back had a son 
born on his wife Penelope, only it was not that foal uhich the 
^mon had got up early to look at and it was almost a week btfore 
they caught, found, the old negress, the midwife who tvas squatting 
beside the quilt pallet that dawn while Jottes sat ok the porch where 
tlte rusty scythe had leaned for two years, so that she could tell how 
she heard the horse and then the demon entered and stood over the 
pallet with tlte riding whip in his hand and looked domi at the 
mother and the child and said, ‘Well, Aiilly, too bad you re not a 
mare like Penelope. Then I could give you a decent stall in the 
stable’ and turned and went out and the old negress squatted there 
and heard them, the voices, he and Jones: ‘Stand back. Dont you 
touch me. Wash.’ — ‘ I’m going to tech you, KemeV and she heard 
the whip too though not the scythe, no whistling air, no blow, 
nothing sitwe always that which merely constmmates punishnsM 
evokes a cry while that which evokes the last silence occurs in si- 
lence. And that night they finally found him and fetclud him home 
in a wagon and carried htm, quiet and bloody and with his teeth 
still showing in his parted beard {which was hardly grizzled d- 
diough his Irnir was almost white notv) in the light of the lanterns 
and the pine torches, up the steps where the tearless and stone-faad 
daughter held the door open for him too who used to like to drive 
fast to church and who rode fast there this time, only when it ivas 
eSi over he had never reached the church, since the daughter decide 
that he should be driven into that same Methodist Church in toim 
where he lutd married her mother, before returning to the grave m

older, not as the wed: grow old, either enclosed in a static bdlom-

vious frametmrk hut to one mother ^ as though in some communal 
md oblivious and mindless life of their otvn like a colony of mag* 
gots, hut as the demon himself had grown old: ivith a kind of con-- 
densatioHy an anguished emergence of the primary indomitable 
ossification which the soft color and texture, the light electric aura 
of youth, had merely temporarily assuaged but never concealed. 
The spinster in homemade and shapeless clothing, with hands 
which could either transfer eggs or hold a plotv straight in furrow, 
borrotved two half-wild young mutes to pull the wagon: so he rode 
fast toward church as far as he went, in his homemade coffin, in his 
regimentals and saber and embroidered gauntlets, until the young 
mules bolted and turned the wagon over and tumbled him, saber 
plumes and all, into a ditch from which the daughter extricated 
him and fetched him hack to the cedar grove and read the service 
herself And no tears, no bereavement this time too, ivhether or not 
it was because she had no time to mourn since she ran the store 
herself now until she found a buyer for it, not keeping it open but 
carrying the keys to it in her apron pocket, hailed from the kitchen 
or the garden or even from the field since she and Clyde now did 
all the plowing which was done, now that Jones was gone too. He 
had followed the demon within twelve hours on that same Sunday 
{and maybe to the same place; maybe They would even have a 
scuppernong vine for them there and no compulsions now of bread 
or ambition or fornication or vengeance, and maybe they wouldnt 
even have to drink, only they tvould miss this now and then with-* 
out knowing what it tvas that they missed but not often; serene, 
pleasant, unmarked by time or change of weather, only just now 
md then something, a wind, a shadow, and the demon would stop 
talking and Jones would stop guffawing and they would look at one 
mother, groping, grave, intent, and the demon would say, ""What 
was it, Wash? Something happened. What was it?* and Jones 
looking at the demon, groping too, sober too, saying, dont know, 
Kernel Whut?* each watching the other. Then the shadow would 

l8&lt;$ 



fade, the wind die away until at last Jones would say, serene, not 
even triumphant: ^Tliey mought have Idlt us, but they aim 
tvhupped us yit, air they?) She would be hailed by women and 
children with pails and baskets, whereupon she or Clytk would go 
to the store, unlock it, serve the customer, lock the store and return: 
until she sold the store at last and spent the money for a tombstone. 

(‘*How was Shrevc said. “You told me; how was it? 
you and your father shooting quail, the gray day after it had 
rained all night and the ditch the horses couldn’t cross so you 
and your father got down and gave the reins to — what was 
his name? the nigger on the mule? Luster — Luster to lead 
them around the ditch”) and he and his father crossed just 
as the rain began to come down again gray and sohd and 
slow, making no sound, Quentin not aware yet of just where 
they w^ere because he had been riding with Ins head lowered 
against the drizzle, until he looked up the slope before them 
where the wet yellow sedge died upward into the rain like 
melting gold and saw the grove, the clump of cedars on the 
crest of the hill dissolving into the rain as if the trees had been 
drawn in ink on a wet blotter — the cedars beyond which, 
beyond the ruined fields beyond which, would be the oak 
grove and the gray huge rotting deserted house half a mile 
aVvay. Mr Compson had stopped to look back at Luster on 
the mule, the towsack he had been using for saddle now 
wrapped around his head, his knees drawn up under it, lead- 
ing the horses on down the ditch to find a place to cross. 
“Better get on out of the rain,” Mr Compson said. “He’s 
not going to come within a hundred yards of those cedars 
anyway.” 

They went on up the slope. They could not see the two 
dogs at all, only the steady furrowing of the sedge where, 
invisible, the dogs quartered the slope until one of them 
flung up his head to look back. Mr Compson gestured with 

187 



his hand toward the trees, he and Quentin following. It was 
dark among the cedars, the light more dark than gray even, 
die quiet rain, the faint pearly globules, materializing on the 
gun barrels and the five headstones like drops of not-quite- 
congealcd meltings fiom cold candles on the marble: the two 
flat heavy vaulted slabs, the other three headstones leaning a 
little awry, with here and there a carved letter or even an 
oatire word momentary and legible in the faint Bght which 
the raindrops brought particle by particle into the gloom 
and released; now the two dogs came in, drifisd in like 
smoke, their hair close-plastered with damp, and curled 
down in one indistinguishable and apparendy inextricable 
ball for warmth. Both the flat slabs were cracked across the 
middle by their own wdght (and vanishing into the hole 
where the brick coping of one vault had fallen in was a 
smooth faint path worn by some small animal— possum 
probably — ^by generations of some small animal since there 
could have been nothing to eat in the grave for a long time) 
though the lettering was quite legible: Ellen Coldfield Sutpm, 
Bom October g, 1817. Died January 2j, 1863 and the odier: 
Thomas Sutpen, Colonel, 23rd Mississippi Infantry, C.S.A, 
Died August 12, l86g: this last, the date, added later, crudely 
with a chisel, who even dead did not divulge where and 
when he had been bom. Quentin looked at the stones quiedy, 
tbitiking Not beloved wife of. No. Ellen Coldjield Sutpen “I 
wouldn’t have thought they would have had any money to 
buy marble with in 1869,” he said. 

“He bought thcmhimself,” Mr Compsonsaid. “Hebought

Judidi got word to him that her mother was dead. He or- 
dered ^m from Italy, the best, the finest to be had — his

while on active servitte with an army which had not only 

T88 



the highest mortality rate of any before or since but which 
had a custom of electing a new set of regimental officers each 
year (and by which system he was at the moment entitled 
to call himself colonel, since he had been voted in and Colonel 
Sartoris voted out only last summer) so that for all he could 
know, before his order could be filled or even received he 
might be already under ground and his grave marked (if at 
aE) by a shattered musket thrust into the earth, or lacking 
diat he might be a second lieutenant or even a private — pro- 
vided of course that his men would have the courage to de- 
mote him — ^yet he not only ordered the stones and managed 
to pay for them, but stranger still he managed to get them 
past a seacoast so closely blockaded that the incoming run- 
ners refused any cargo except ammunition It seemed 

to Quentin that he could actually see them: the ragged and 
starving troops without shoes, the gaunt powder-blackened 
faces looking backward over tattered shoulders, the gkrirg 
eyes in which burned some indomitable despoadon of un- 
di^eat watching that dark interdict ocean across which a 
grim lighdess solitary ffiip Bed with in its hold two thousand 
precious pounds-spaa: containing not bullets, not evai some- 
thing to eat, but that much bombasdc and inert carven rock 
whick for the next year was to be a part of the regiment, to 
foEow it into Pennsylvania and be present at Gettysburg, 
moving behind the regiment in a wagon driven by the de- 
mon’s body servant through swamp and plain and moun- 
tain pass, ^ regjament moving no fester than the wagon 
could, with starved gaunt men and gaunt spent horses kiffie 
deep in icy mud or snow, sweating and cursing it throu|^ 
bog and morass Eke a pi«x of ardllery, speaking of the two 
stones as ‘Colonel’ and ‘Mrs Colonel’; then through the 
CtMoberland Gap and &lt;k&gt;wn through the Tennestee moun- 
tains, travdffig at n^t to dodge Yankee patrols, and aato 



Mississippi in the late fall of *64, where the daughter waited 
whose marriage he had interdict and who was to be a widow 
the next summer though apparently not bereaved, where 
his wife was dead and his son self-excommunicated and 
-banished, and put one of the stones over his wife’s grave 
and set the other upright in the hall of the house, where Miss 
Coldfield possibly (maybe doubtless) looked at it every day 
as though it were his portrait, possibly (maybe doubtless 
here too) reading among the lettering more of maiden hope 
and virgin expectation than she ever told Quentin about, 
since she never mentioned the stone to him at all, and (the 
demon) drank the parched com coffee and ate the hoe cake 
which Judith and Clytie prepared for him and kissed Judith 
on the forehead and said, ‘Well, Clyde’ and returned to the 
war, all in twenty-four hours; he could see it; he might even 
have been there. Then he thought No. If I had been there I 
could not have seen it this plain. 

“But that dont explain the other three,” he said. “They 
must have cost something too.” 

“Who would have paid for them?” Mr Compson said. 
Quentin could feel him looking at him. “Think.” Quendn 
looked at the three identical headstones with their f^t iden- 
tical lettering, slanted a little in the soft loamy decay of ac- 
cumulated cedar needles, these decipherable too when he 
looked dose, the first one: Charles Bon. Bom in New Orleans, 
Louisiana. Died at Sutpens Hundred, Mississippi, May 3, 1863. 
Aged 33 years and 5 months. He could fed his fether watxhing 
him. 

“She did it,” he said. “With that money she got whai she 
sold the store.” 

“Yes,” Mr Compson said. Quentin had to stoop and bneh 
away some of the cedar needles to read the next one. As 
he dd so one of the dogs rose and approached him, thrust- 
ipo 



ing its head m to see what he was looking at hke a hnmau 
being would, as if from association with human beings it had 
acquired the quahty of curiosity which is an attribute only 
of men and apes. 

“Get away,” he said, thrusting the dog back with one 
hand while with the other he brushed Ae cedar nppdlfg 
away, smoothing with his hand into legibility the faint let- 
tering, the graved words: Charles Etienne Saint-Vakry Bon. 
185^1884 feeling his father watching him, remarking before 
he rose that the third stone bore that same date, 1884. “It 
couldn’t have been the store this time,” he said. “Because 
she sold the store in ’70, and besides 1884 is the same date 
that’s on hers” thinking how it would have been temble for 
her sure enough if she had wanted to put Beloved Husband of 
on that first one. 

“Ah,” Mr Compson said. “That was the one your grand- 
£ither attended to. Judith came into town one day and 
brought him the money, some of it, where she got it from 
he never knew, unless it was what she had left out of the 
price of the store which he sold for her; brought the money 
in with the inscription (except the date of death of course) 
all written out as you see it, during that three weeks while 
Clyde was in New Orleans finding the boy to fetch him 
back, though your grandfather of course did not know this, 
money and inscription not for herself but for him.” 

“Oh,” Quentin said. 

“Yes. They lead beautiful lives — ^women. Lives not only 
divorced from, but irrevocably excommunicated from, all 
reality. That’s why although their deaths, the instant of dis- 
solution, are of no importance to them since they have a 
courage and fortitude in the face of pain and annihilation 
which would make the most spartan man resemble a puling 
boy, yet to them their funersJs and graves, the little puny 

191 



affirmations of spurious inunortality set above tlieir slumber, 
are of mcalculable importance. You had an aunt once (you 
do not remember her because I never saw her myself but 
only heard the tale) who was faced with a serious operation 
which she became convinced she would not survive, at a 
time when her nearest female kin was a woman between 
whom and herself there had existed for years one of those 
bitter inexplicable (to the man mind) amicable enmities 
which occur between women of the same blood, whose sole 
worry about departing this world was to get rid of a certain 
brown dress which she owned and knew that the kinswoman 
knew she had never hked, which must be burned, not given 
away but burned in the back yard beneath the window 
where, by being held up to the window (and suffering ex- 
crutiating pain) she could see it burned with her own eyes, 
because she was convinced that after she died the kinswoman, 
the logical one to take charge, would bury her in it.” 

“And did she diet” Quentin said. 

“No. As soon as the dress was consumed she began to 
mend. She stood the operation and recovered and outlived 
the kinswoman by several years. Then one afternoon she 
died peacefully of no particular ailment and was buried in 
her wedding gown.” 

“Oh,” Quentin said. 

“Yes. But there w^ one afternoon in the summer of ’70 
when one of these graves (there were only three here then) 
was actually watered by tears. Your grandfather saw it; that 
was the year Judith sold the store and your grandfether at- 
tended to it for her and he had ridden out to see her about 
the matter and he witnessed it: the interlude, the ceremonial 
widowhood’s bright dramatic pageantry. He didn’t know 
at the time how ffie octoroon came to lx here, how Judith 
could even have known about her to write her where Bon 

i$z 



was dead. But there she was, with the eieven-year-cld boy 
who looked more like eight It must have resembled a gar- 
den scene by the Irish poet, Wilde: the late afternoon, the 
dark cedars with the level sun in them, even the ligbr ex- 
actly right and the graves, the three pieces of marble (your 
grandfather had advanced Judith the money to buy the third 
stone with against the price of the store) looking as though 
they had been cleaned and polished and arranged by scene 
shifters who with the passing of twilight would return and 
strike them and carry them, hollow fragile and without 
weight, back to the warehouse until they should be needed 
again; the pageant, the scene, the act, entering upon the 
stage — the magnolia-faced woman a httle plumper now, a 
woman created of by and for darkness whom the artist 
Beardsley might have dressed, in a soft flowing gown de- 
signed not to infer bereavement or widowhood but to dress 
some interlude of slumbrous and fatal insatiation, of passion- 
ate and inexorable hunger of the flesh, walking beneath a 
lace parasol and followed by a bright gigantic negress carry- 
ing a silk cushion and leading by the ban d the litde boy 
whom Beardsley might not only have dressed but drawn — a 
thin delicate child with a smooth ivory sexless face who, 
after his mother handed the negress the parasol and took the 
cu^on and knelt beside die grave and arranged her skirts 
and wept, never released the negress’ apron but stood blink- 
ing (juiedy who, having been bom and lived all his life in a 
kind of silken prison lighted by perpetual shaded candles, 
breathing for air the milklike and absolutely physical 1am- 
bence which his mother’s days and hours emanated,had seen 
litde enough of sunlight before, let alone out-of-doors, trees 
and gra^ and eardi; and last of all, the other woman, Judith 
(who, not bereaved, did not need to mourn Quentin-thought, 
thinking Yes, I have had to li^en too long) who stood just in- 

193 



nde die cedars, in. the calico dress and the sunbonnet to 
match it, both &amp;ded and shapeless — the calm face, the hands 
which could plow or cut wood and cook or weave cloth 
folded before her, standing in the attitude of an indifferent 
guide in a museum, waiting, probably not even watching. 
Then the negress came and handed the octoroon a crystal 
bottle to smell and helped her to rise and took up the silk 
cushion and gave the octoroon the parasol and they returned 
to the house, the httle boy still holding to the negress* apron, 
the negress supporting the woman with one arm and Judith 
following witii that face like a mask or like marble, back to 
the house, across the tall scaling portico and into the house 
where Clytie was cooking the eggs and the com bread on 
which she and Judith lived. 

“She stayed a week. She passed the rest of that week in the 
one remaining room in the house whose bed had linen 
sheets, passed it m bed, in the new lace and silk and satin 
negligees subdued to the mauve and lilac of mourning — 
that room airless and shuttered, impregnated behind the sag- 
ging closed blinds with the heavy fainting odor of her flesh, 
her days, her hours, her garments, of eau-de-cologne from 
the doth upon her temples, of the crystal phial which the 
negress alternated with the fan as she sat beside the bed be- 
tween trips to the door to receive the trays which dytic 
carried up the stairs — ^Clytie, who did that fetching and car- 
rying as Judith made her, who must have perceived whether 
Juditii told her or not that it was another negro whom she 
served, yet who served the negress just as she would quit the 
kitchen from time to time and search the rooms downstairs 
until she found that little strange lonely boy atting quiedy 
on a straight hard chair in the dim and diadowy library or 
parlor, with his four names and his sixteenth-^art black 
blood, and his eiqiensive esoteric Faunderoy dothing who 

194 ' 



regarded with aa aghast fatalistic terror the grim cofiec- 
colored woman who would come on hare feet to the door 
and look in at hi m , who gave him not teacakes but the coars- 
est combread spread widi as coarse molasses (this surrepti- 
tiously, not that the mother or the duenna might: object^ bat 
because the household did not have feod for eating between 
meals), gave it to him, thrust it at him with restrained sav- 
ageness, and who found him one afternoon playing with a 
negro boy about his own size in the road outside die gatpg 
and cursed the negro child out of sight with level and deadly 
violence and sent him, the other, back to the house in a voice 
feom which the very absence of vituperation or r^ made 
it seem just that much more deadly and cold. 

“Yes, Clyde, who stood impassive beside the wagon cm 
that last day, following (he second ceremonial to dte grave 
with the silk cushion and the parasol and the smelling-lmttk;, 
when mother and child and duenna departed for New Or- 
leans. And your grandfather never knew if it was Clytic who 
watched, kept in touch by some means, waited fe&gt;r the day, 
the moment, to come, the hour when the litde boy wcndd 
be an orphan, and so went herself to fetch him ; or if it was 
Judith who did the waiting and the watching and sent Clyde 
fe»r him that winter, that December of 1871 — Clyde who 
had never been further from Sutpen’s Hundred than Je6fer- 
son in her life, yet who made that journey alone to New Or- 
leans and returned with the duld, the boy of twelve now 
and looking ten, in one of the outgrown Fauntleroy suits 
but with a new oversize overall jumper coat which Clyde 
had bought for him (and made him wear, whether again^ 
the cold or whether not your grandfether could not say 
either) over it and what else he owned tied up in a bandanna 
handkerchief— this child who could ^)eak no E ng lish as the 
woman could speak no French, who had found him, hunted 

19s 



him ciown, in a French dty and brought him away, this 
child with a face not old but without age, as if he had had 
no childhood, not in the sense that Miss Rosa Coldfield says 
she had no childhood, hut as if he had not been human bom 
but instead created without agency of man or agony of 
woman and orphaned by no human being. Your grandfether 
said you did not wonder what had become of the mother, 
you did not even care: death or elopement or marriage: she 
would not grow firom one metamorphosis — dissolution or 
adultery — ^to the neict carrying along with her all the old ac- 
cumulated rubbish-years which we call memory, the recog- 
nizable I, but changing firom phase to phase as the butterfly 
changes once the cocoon is cleared, cairying nothing of what 
was into what is, leaving nothing of what is behind but elid- 
ing complete and intact and unresisting into the next avatar 
as the overblown rose or magnolia elides from one rich June 
to the next, leaving no bones, no substance, no dust of what- 
ever dead pristine soulless rich surr^der anywhere between 
sun and earth. The boy had been produced complete and 
subject to no microbe in that cloyed and scented maze of 
shuttered silk as if he were the d^cate and perverse spirit- 
symbol, immortal page of the ancient immortal Lilith, en- 
tering the actual world not at the age of one second but of 
twelve years, the delicate garments of his pagehood already 
half concealed beneath that harsh and shapeless denim cut 
to an iron pattern and sold by the millions — that burlesque 
uniform and regalia of the tragic burlesque of the sons of 
Ham — a slight silent child who could not even speak Eng- 
lish, picked suddenly up out of whatever debacle the only 
life he knew had disintegrated into, by a creatom whom he 
had seen once and learned to dread and fear yet could not 
flee, -held helples and passive in a state which must have 
been some inorcdible compound of horror and trust, since 
196 



although he could not even talk to her (they made, they 
must have made, that week’s journey by steamboat among 
the cotton bales on the freight deck, eating and sleeping wnth 
negroes, where he could not even tell his companion when 
he was hungry or when he had to relieve himelfj and so 
could have only suspeaed, surmised, where she was taking 
him, could have known nothing certainly except that all he 
had ever been fa m iliar with was v anishing about him like 
smoke. Yet he made no resistance, returning quietly and do- 
cilely to that decaying house which he had seen one rim&lt;&gt;^ 
where the fierce brooding woman who had come and got 
him lived with the calm white one who was not even fierce, 
who was not anything except calm, who to him did not 
even have a name yet, but who was somehow so closely re- 
lated to him as to be the owner of the one spot on earth 
where he had ever seen his mother weep. He crossed that 
strange threshold, that irrevocable demarcation, not led, not 
dragged, but driven and herded by that stem implacable 
presence, into that gaunt and barren household where his 
very silken remaining clothes, his delicate shirt and stockiogs 
and shoes which soil remained to remind him of what he 
had once been, vanished, fled from arms and body and 
as if they had been woven of chimaeras or of smoke. — ^Yes, 
sleeping in the trundle bed beside Judith’s, beside that of the 
woman who looked upon him and treated him with a cold 
unbending detached gentleness more discoursing than the 
fierce ruthless constant guardianship of the negress who, 
with a sort of invincible spurious humility slept on a pallet 
on the floor, the child lying there betweai them un^eep in 
some hiatus of passive and hopdess despair aware of this, 
aware of the woman on the bed whose every look and action 
toward him, whose every touch of the capable hands seemed 
die moment of tooching his body to lose all wamaihand

become imbued with cold implacable antipathy, and the 
woman on the pallet upon whom he had already come to 
look as might some delicate talonless and fangless wild beast 
crouched in its cage in some hopeless and desperate simili- 
tude of ferocity look upon the human cr^ture who feeds it 
(and your grandfather said, ‘Suffer little children to come 
unto Me’: and what did He mean by that? how, if He meant 
that little children should need to be suffered to approach 
Him, what sort of earth had He created; that if they had to 
suffer in order to approach Him, what sort of Heaven did 
He have?) who fed him, thrust food which he himself could 
discern to be the choicest of what they had, food which 
he realized had been prepared for him by deliberate sacrifice, 
with that curious blend of savageness and pity, of yeammg 
and hatred; who dressed him and washed him, thrust him in- 
to tubs of water too hot or too cold yet against which he 
dared make no outcry, and scrubbed him with harsh rags 
and soap, sometimes scrubbing at him with repressed fury as 
if she were trying to wash the smooth faint tinge from his 
skin as you might watch a child scrubbing at a wsdl long after 
the epithet, the chalked insult, has been obhterated — ^lyii^ 
there unsleeping in the dark between them, feeling them un- 
asleep too, feeling them thinking about him, projecting about 
him and fillin g the thunderous solitude of his despair louder 
than speecli could: You are not up here in this bed unth me, 
where through no fault nor willing of your own you should he, and 
you are not down here on diis pallet floor with me, where through 
no fault nor willing of your own you must and will be, not through 
any fault or willing of our own who would not what we amnoL 
“And your granifetther did not know either just which of 
dhem it was who told him that he was, must be, a negro. He 
could neither have heard yet nor recognized the term ‘nig- 
ger/ who evoi had no word £ot it in the tx&gt;i^;ae he knew 
198 



who had beoi bora and grown up in a padded silken vacuum 
cell which might have been suspended on a cable a thousand 
fathoms in the sea, where pigmentation had no more moral 
value than the silk walls and the scent and the rose-colored 
candle shades, where the very abstractions which he might 
have observed — ^monogamy and fidelity and decorum and 
gentleness and affection — ^were as purely rooted in the flesh’s 
offices as the digestive processes. Your grandfather did not 
know if he was sent fiom the trundle bed at last or if he 
quitted it by his own wish and will; if when the time came 
when his loneliness and grief became calloused, he retired 
himself from Judith’s bedroom or was sent from it, to sleep 
in the ball (where Clytie had likewise moved her pallet) 
though not on a pallet like her but on a cot, elevated still and 
perhaps not byjudith’s decree either but by the negress’ fierce 
inexorable spurious humility. And then the cot was moved 
in the atde, and the few garments hanging behind a curtain 
contrived of a piece of old carpet nailed across a comer, the 
rags of the silk and broadcloth in which he had arrived, the 
harsh jeans and homespun which the two womai bought 
and made for him, he accepting them with no thanks, no 
comment, accepting his garret room in the same way, asking 
for and making no altaration in its spartan arrangements that 
they knew of until that second year when he was fourteen 
and one of them, Clytie or Judith, fiiund hidden beneath his 
mattress the shard of broken mirror: and who to know what 
hours of amazed and tearless grief he might have spent be- 
fore it, examining himself in the delicate and outgrown tat- 
ters in which he perhaps could not even remember himself, 
with quiet and incredulous incomprehension. And Clytie 
slipping in the ball below, barring the foot of the attic stairs, 
guarding his escape or exit as inexorably as a Spanish duenna, 
tparbing bim to chop wood and to work the garden and thm 

199 



to plow as his strength increased. His resiliency rather, since 
he would never be other than light in the bone and almost 
delicate — the boy with his light bones and womanish hands 
struggling with what anonymous avatar of intractable Mule, 
whatever tragic and barren clown was his bound fellow and 
complement beneath his first father’s curse, getting the hang 
of it gradually and the two of them, linked by the savage 
stcel-and-wood male symbol, ripping from the prone rich 
female earth com to feed them both. "While Clytie watched, 
never out of sight of him, with that brooding fierce unflag- 
ging jealous care, hunying out whenever anyone white or 
black stopped in the road as if to wait for the boy to com- 
plete the furrow and pause long enough to be spoken to, 
sending the boy on with a single quiet word or even gesture 
a hundred times more fierce than the level murmur of vitu- 
peration with which she drove the passerby on. So he (your 
grandfather) believed that it was neither of them who was 
responsible for his going with negroes. Not Clytie, who 
guarded him as if he were a Spanish virgin, who even before 
she could have even suspected that he would ever come there 
to live, had interrupted his first contact with a nigger and 
sent him back to the house; not Judith who could have re- 
fused at any time to let him sleep in that white child’s bed in 
her room, who even if she could not have reconciled herself 
to his sleeping on the floor could have forced Clytie to take 
him into, another bed with her, who would have made a 
monk, a cehbate, of him, perhaps yet not a eunuch, who may 
not have permitted him to pass himself for a fi&gt;reigner, yet 
who certainly would not have driven him to consort with 
negroes. Your grandfather didn’t know, even though he did 
know more than the town, the countryside, knew, which 
was that there was a strange Utde boy living out there who 
had apparently emerged from the house for the first time at 
aqo 



tie age of about twdve yean, whose presecwx was not even 
tjnaccountable to the town and county siiux they now bo- 
leved they knew why Henry had shot Bon. They wondered 
only where and how Clyde and Judith had managed to keep 
bim concealed all the dme, believing now diat it had been a 
widow who had buried Bon, even Aough she had no paper 
to show for it, and only the incredulous (and shocked) specu- 
kdon of your grandfather (who, though he had that hundred 
dollars and the written directions in Judith’s hand for this 
fourth tombstone in his safe at the rime, had not yet associated 
the boy with the child he had seen two years ago when the 
octoroon came there to weep at the grave), to beucvc that 
the child might be Clyde’s, got by its father on the body of 
his own daughter. A boy seen always near the house with 
Clyde always nearby, then a youth learning to plov/ and 
Clyde somewhere nearby too and it soon well known with 
what grim and unflagging alertness she discovered and inter- 
rupted any attempt to speak to him, and diere was only your 
grandfather to couple atlast the boy, theyouth, with the child 
who had been there three or four years ago to visit that grave. 

It was your grandfelher to whose office Judith came that 
afternoon five years later, and he could not remember when 
he had seal her in Jefierson before — the woman of forty now, 
in the same shapdess calico and fiided sunbonnet, who would 
not even sit down, who dapite the impenetrable mask which 
die used for face emanated a terrible urgency, who insisted 
that they walk on toward the courthouse •while she talked, 
toward the crowded room where the justice’s court sat, the 
crowded room which they entered and whae your grand- 
father saw him, the boy (only a man now) handcuffed to an 
officer, his other arm in a sling and his head bandaged siiux 
they had taken him to the doctor first, your grandfelhcr gradr- 
ually Iffamitig what had happened or as much of it as he 

201 



couM since the Court itself couldn’t very much otu; of 
the wiaeoses, the ones who had fled and sent for the sheiiC 
the ones (excepting that one whom he had injured too badly 
to be presait) with whom he had fought. It had happened at 
a negro ball held in a cabin a few miles 6om Sutpen’s Hun- 
dred and he there, present and your grandfather never to 
fcaow how often he had done this before, whether he had 
gone there to engage in the dancing or for the dice game in 
progress in the kitchen where the trouble started, trouble 
which he and not the negroes started according to the wit- 
nesses and for no reason, for no accusation of cheating, noth- 
ing. And he made no denial, saying nothing, reftising to 
speak at aU, sitting there in court sullen, pale and silent: so 
that at this point all truth, evidaice vanished into a moiling 
dump of negro backs and heads and black ar m s and hands 
dutching sticks of stove wood and cooking implemaits and 
raajre, the white man the focal point of it and using a knife 
which he had produced firom somewhere, dumsily, with ob- 
vious lack of skill and practice, yet with deadly earnestness 
and 3 strength whkh. his slight buiH denied, a strength com- 
posed of sheer draperate will and imperviousness to the pun- 
ishment, the blovirs and slashes which he took in mtum and 
did not even seem to feel Ihere had been no cause, no rea- 
son for it; none to ever know exactly what happened, what 
curses and ejaculations which might have indicated what it 
was that drove him, and there was only your grandfather to 
fiimbfe, grope, grasp the presence of that fiuious protest^ that 
indictment of heaven’s ordering, fliat gage flung into the face 
of what is with a furious and indomitable desperation which 
the demon himself might have shown, as if the child and then 
the youth had acquired it from the walls in which the demon 
had lived, the air width he had once walked in and breathed 
imtfl that moment when his own fete which he had dared in 



Jbis tom struck bad: at him; only your grandfether to sense 
that protest, because the justice and the odiers present did not 
recognize him, did not ra:ognize this sHght man with his 
bandaged head and arm, his sullen impassive (and now 
bloodless) olive face, who refused to answer any questions, 
make any statement: so that the justice (Jim Hamblett it was) 
was already making his qtmdi of indictn^t when your 
grand&amp;ther entered, ndlizmg opportunity and audience to 
orate, his eyes already glazed with that cessation of vision of 
people who like to hear themselves talk in public: ‘At this 
time, while our country is struggling to rise from beneath 
the iron heel of a tyrant oppressor, when the very future of 
the South as a place bearable for our women and children to 
live in depands on the labor of our own hands, when the 
tools which we have to use, to depend on, are the pride and 
integrity and forbearance of black men and the pride and in- 
tegrity and forbearance of white; that you, I say, a white 

man, a white * and your grandfather trying to reach 

him, stop him, trying to push through the crowd, saying 
‘Jim. Jim. Jim!* and it already too late, as if Hamblett’s own 
voi(te had waked him at last or as if someone had snapped 
his fingers under his nose and waked him, he looking at the 
prisoner now but saying ‘white’ again even while bis voice 
died away as if the order to stop the voke had been shocked 
into short circuit, and every face in the room turned toward 
the prisoner as Hamblett cried, ‘What are you} Who and 
where did you come Jromf 

“Your grandfother got him out, quashed the indictment 
paid the fine and brought him back to his office and 
taltrpd to him while Judith waited in the anteroom. ‘You are 
rbarlfs Bon s son,’ he said. ‘I dont know,’ the other aa?- 
swere4 harsh and sullen. ‘You dont remember?’ your grand- 
fitW said. The other did not answer. Then your grand- 



fether told him he must go away, disappear, gmug him 
money to go on: ‘What ever you are, once you are among 
stKHJ^ers, people who dont know you, you can be whatever 

you wilL I make it all right; I telk to — to 

What do you call her j* And he had gone too far now, but 
it was too late to stop; he sat there and looked at that still face 
which had no more espression than Judith’s, nothing of hope 
nor pain: just sullen and inscrutable and lookhig down at the 
calloused womanish hands with their cracked bails which 
held the money while your grandfather thought how he 
ojuld not say ‘Miss Judith,’ since that would postulate the 
blood more than ever. Then he thought I dottt even know 
whether he wmts to hide it or not. So he said Miss Sutpen. ‘I will 
tell Miss Sutpen, not where you are going of course, because 
I wont know that myself. But just that you are gone and that 
I knew you were going and that you will be all right.’ 

“So he departed, and your grandfather rode out to tell 
Judith, and 0ytie came to the door and looked full and 
steadily at his £aos and said nothing and went to call Judith, 
and your grand&amp;ther waited in that dim shrouded parlor 
and ^ew that he would not have to tell dther of therm He 
did not have to. Judith came presently and stood and looked

stopped, with that &amp;rlom little boy invisible between them

overalls — of his ancient curse, who had become the young 
man with a your^- man’s potence, yet was still that lonely

deed, belter that he had never lived: dien dilnking what vain 
and empty recapitulation that would be to her if he were to 
say it, who doubtless had already said it, thought it, chang- 
ing only the person and the number. He returned to town. 
And now, next time, he W'as not sent for; he learned it as the 
town learned it: by that country grapevine whose source is 
among negroes, and he, Charles Etienne Saint-Valcry Bon, 
already returned (not home again; returned) before your 
grandfather kamed how he had come back, appeared, with 
a coal black and ape-like woman and an authentic wedding 
license, brought back by the woman since he had been so 
severely beaten and mauled recently that he could not even 
hold himself on the spavined and saddkless mule on which 
he rode whik his wife walked beside it to keep liim from fall- 
ing off; rode up to the house and apparently flung the wed- 
ding license in Judith’s face with something of that mvmdbk 
despair with which he had attacked the negroes in the dice 
game. And none ever to know what incredibk tak lay be- 
hind that year’s absence whidi he never referred to and which 
the woman, who, even a year later and after their son was 
bom, still existed in that aghast and automaton-hke state in 
which she had arrived, did not, possibly could not, recount 
but which she seemed to exude gradually and by a process 
of terrific and incredulous excretion like’ die sweat of fear 
or anguish: how he had found her, dragged her out of what- 
ever two dimensional backwater (the very name of whidi, 
town or village, she either had never known or the shock of 
her exodus from it had driven the name forever from her 
mind and memory) her mentality had been capabk of co- 
ercing fix)d and shdter from, and married her, held her very 
band doubdess wMk she made the laborious cross on the 
register before she even knew his name or knew that he was 

20S 



not 3 wMte man (and this last none knew evoi now if die 
knew for certain, even after the son was bom in one of the 
dilapidated slave cabins which he rebuilt after renting his 
parcel of land from Judith); how there followed something 
like a year composed of a succession of periods of utter kor- 
mobdity like a broken cinema film, wfai&lt;^ the white-colored 
man who had married her spent on his back recovering from 
the last mauling he had received, in frowzy stinking rooms 
in places— towns and cities — ^which likewise had no names 
to her, broken by other periods, intervals, of furious and in- 
comprehensible and apparently reasonless movic^, progres- 
sion— a maelstrom of faces and bodies through which the 
man thrust, dragging her behind him, toward or from what, 
driven by what fury which would not let him rest, she did 
not know, each one to end, finish, as the one before it had so 
that it was almost a rituaL The man apparendy hunting out 
situations in order to flaunt and fling the ape-like body of his 
charcoal companion in the frcra of all and any who would 
retaliate; the negro stevedores and deckhands on steamboats 
or in cky honky-tonks who thought he was a white man and 
beheved tt only the more strongly when he denied it; the 
white men vho, when he said he was a negro, believed that 
he liai in order to save his skin, or worse: from sheer besot- 
ment of sexual perversion; in either case die: result the same: 
the man with body and limbs almost as light and delict as 
a girl's ^ving the first blow, usually unarmed and heedless 
of the numbers opposed to him, with that same fury and im- 
placability and physical imperviousness to pain and punhh- 
ment, neither cursing nor pandng, but laughing. 

“So he showed Judith the hcense and took his wife, already 
for gone with the child, to the ruined cabin which he had 
chosen to rc^iair and installed her, kenneled her with a gesture 
perhaps, and letumed to the house. And thore was nobody 
sxuS 



to know what transpired that evening ijetween him and 
Judiih, in whatever carpedess room furnished with whatever 
chairs and such which Aey had not had to chop up and bum 
to cook food or for warmth or maybe to heat water for ill- 
ness from time to time — ^between the woman who had been 
widowed before she had been a bride, and the son of the man 
who had bereaved her and a hereditary negro concubine, 
who had not resented his black blood so much as he had de- 
nied the white, and this with a curious and outrageous 
exaggeration in which was inherent its own irrevocabihty, 
almost exaedy as the demon himself might have done it. 

(Because there was love Mr Compson said There was that 
tetter she brought and gave to your grandmother to keep. He 
(Quentin) could see it, as plairdy as he saw the one open upon 
the open text book on the table before him, white in his 
father’s dark hand against h'^ linen leg in the September twi- 
light where the dgar-smeU, the wistaria-smdl, the fire-flies 
drifted, thinking Yes. I have heard too much, I have been told 
too much; I have had to listen to too much, too long thinking Yes,- 
Skreve sounds almost exactly like father: that letter. And who to 
know what moral restoration she might have contemplated in tke 
privacy of that house, that room, that night, what hurdling of iron 
old traditions since she had seen almost everything else she had 
learned to call stable vanish like straws in a galeshe sitting there 
beside the lamp in a straight chair, erect, in the same calico save 
that the sunbonnet would be missing now, the head hare now, the 
once coal-black hair streaked with gray now while he faced her, 
standing. He would not have sat; perhaps she would not even 
have asked him to, and the cold level voice would not be much 
louder than the sound of the lamp’s flame: T was wrong. I admit 
it. I believed that there were things which still mattered just be- 
cause they had mattered once. But I was wrong. Nothing matters 
but breath, breathing, to know and to be alive. And the child,

the license, the paper. What about it? That paper is betmen you 
and me who is inescapably negro; it can he put aside, no one will 
anyttwre dare bring it up than any other prank of a young man 
in his wild youth. And as for the child, all right. Didn’t my 
own father beget one? and he none the worse for it? We will even 
keep the woman and the child if you wish; they can stay here 
and Clytie will . , . ’ watching Urn, staring at him yet not 
moving, immobile, erect, her hasids folded motionless on her lap, 
hardly brccuhing as if he were some wild bird or beast which

the movement of her breast: ‘No: I. I ivill. I will raise it, see 
that it .. . It does not need to have any name; you will neither 
have to see it again nor to worry. We will have General Compson 
sell some of the land; he will do it, and y:u can go. Into the

moving, not stirring 's\^tching him, still seeing him, pene- 
trating walls and darkness too to watcht him walk hack down 
the weedy lane between the deserted collapsed cabins toward 
that one w'here his wife waited, treading the thorny and flint- 
pa\ ed patJi toward the Gethsemane which he had decreed 
and created for himself, where he had crucified himself and 
come down firom his cross for a moment and novr retumal 
to it. 

“Not your grandfather. He knew only what the town, 
the county, knew: that the strange little boy whom Ciytic 
had used to watch and had taught to farm, who had sat, a 
grown man, in the justice’s court that day widi his head band- 
aged and one arm in a sling and the other in a handcufi*, who 
had vanished and then returned with an authentic wife re- 
sembling something in a zoo, now farmed on shares a por- 
tion of the Sutpen plantation, farmed it pretty well, with 
solitary and steady husbandry within his physical limitations, 
the body and limbs which still looked too light for the task 
which he had set himself, who lived like a hermit in the cabin 
which he rebuilt and where his son was presently bom, who 
consorted with neither white nor black (Clytie did not watch 
hiin now; she did not need to) and who was not seen in 
ferson but three times during the next four years and then to 
appear, be reported by the negroes who seemed to fear cither 
him or Clytie or Juith, as being either blind or violently 
drunk in the negro store district on Depot Street, where your 
grandfather would come and take him away (or if he were 
too drunk, had become violent, the town officers) and keep 
him until his wife, the black gargoyle, could hitch the team 
back into the wagon and come, with nothing alive about her 
but her eyes and hands, and load him into it and take him 
So they did not even miss him firom town at first; it 
was the County Medical Officer who told your grandfather 

209 



tliat he had yeQow &amp;vex and, that Judith had had him moved 
into the big house and was nursing him and now Judith had 
the disease too, and your grandfather told him to notify Miss 
Coldfield and he (your grandfether) rode out there one day. 
He did not dismount; he sat his horse and called until Clyde 
looked down at him from one of the upper windows and 
told him ‘dbey didn’t need nothing.’ Within the week your 
grandfrther learned that Clyde had been right, or was right, 
now anyway, though it was Judith who died first.” 

*'Oh,” Quentin said — Yes he thought Too much, too long 
remembering how he had looked at the fifth grave and 
thought how whoever had buried Judith must have been 
afraid that the other dead would contract the disease from 
her, since her grave was at the opposite side of the enclosure, 
as fiur from the other four as the enclosure would permit, 
thinking Fatlier wont have to say ‘thin^ this time because he 
knew who had ordered and bought that headstone before he 
read the inscripdon on it, thinking about, imagining what 
camful printed direcdons Judith must have roused herself 
(from delirium possibly) to write down fiir Clyde when she 
knew that she was going to die; and how Clytfe must have 
lived during the nejct twelve yean while she raised dhe child

sa:«d die money to finish paying out for the stcme on which 
Judith had paid his grandfather the hundred dollars twenty- 
four years ago and which, when his grandfather tried to re- 
fiise it; she (Clyde) set the rusty can full of nkkds and dimes 
and frayed paper money on the desk and walked out of the 
office without a word. He had to brush the chnging cedar 
needles from this one also to read it; watching these letters 
also emorge baieah, his hand, wondaii^ qniedy how they

Judith ColdJieU Sutpen. Daughter of Ellen Coldjield. Bom 
October j, 1841. Suffered the Indignities and Travails of diis 
World for 42 Years, 4 Months, g Days, and went to Re^ &lt;a Last 
February 12, 18S4. Pause, Mortal; Remember Vanity and Folly 
and Beivare t hink i n g (Quentin) Yes. I didn’t need to ask who 
invented that, put that one up thinking Yes, too much, too long. 
I didn’t need to listen then but I had to hear it arid now I am hav- 
ing to hear it all over again because he sounds just like father: 
Beautiful lives women live-women do. In very breathing they 
draw meat and drink from some beautiful attetmation of unreality 
in which the shades and shapes of facts— of birth and bereavement, 
of suffering and beivilderment and despair— move with the suh- 
stanceless decorum of lawn party charades, perfect in gesture and 
without significance or any ability to hurt. Miss Rosa ordered that 
one. She decreed that headstone of Judge Benbow. He had been 
the executor of her father’s estate, appointed by no will since Ms 
Coldjield left neither will nor estate except the house and the rifled 
shell of the store. So he appointed himself, elected himself probably 
out of some conclave of neighbors and citizens who came togeAm 
to discuss her affairs and what to do mth her after they realized 
duit nothing under the sun, certainly no man twr committee of mm, 
would ever persuade her to go back to her niece and brother-in- 
law — the same citizens and neighbors who left baskets of food on 
her doorstep at night, the dishes {the plate containing the food, the 
napkins which covered it) from which she never washed hut re- 
turned soiled to the empty basket and set die basket hack on the 
same step where she had found it as if to uuty completely out the 
illusion that it had never existed or at least dmt she had never 
touched, emptied, it, had not come out and taken the basket up with 
dtat dr which had nothing whatever of furtiveness in it nor evert 
drfiarux, who doubtless tasted dw food, aitidzed its qudity or 
cooking, (hewed and swdlmed it and felt it dgest yet Mill clung 
' to dtat dehmon, that ceSm incorrigible insistence that drat which dl 



immtrovertihh evidence telb her is so does not exist, as women 
can — that same self Muding which dkclined to admit that the 
li^idatioti of the store had I ft her something, that she had been 
kfi anything but a complete pauper, she would not accept the 
aOud money from the sale of the store fiom Judge Betibow yet 
would accept the money* s value (and afier a few years, over-value) 
in a dozen tvays: would use casual negro boys who happened to 
pass the house, stopping them and commanding them to rake her 
yard and they doubtless as aware as the town was that time would 
be no mention of pay from her, that they would not even see her 
again though they knew she was watching them fiom behind the 
curtains of a window, but that Judge Benbow would pay them. She 
would enter the stores and command objects from the shelves and 
showcases exactly as she commanded that two hundred dollar head- 
stone from Judge Benbow, and walk out of the store with thetn — 
and with the same aberrant cunning which would not wash the 
dishes and napkins fiom the baskets she declined to have any discus- 
sion of her affairs with Benbow since she must have known that the 
sums which she had received from him must have years ago over- 
balanced (he, Benbow, had in his office aporfolio, a fat one, tvith 
JEstats of Goodhue Coldfield. Private written across it in in- 
delible ink. After the Judge died his son Percy opened it. It was 
filed with racing forms and cancelled betting tickets on horses 
whose very hortes tvere no man knew where now, whith had won 
and lost races on the Memphis track forty years ago, and a ledg&amp;, 
a carefid tabulation in the June's hand, each entry indicating the 
date and the horse* s name and his wager and whether he won or 
lott; md another one showing how for forty years he had put each 
winnif^ cmd an momt equd to each h^, to dtat mythicd m- 
comt) whoever die store Imd brought. 

But you were not listening, because you knew it all edready, had 
homed, absorbed it edready without the medium of speech some- 
how fim having ken horn md living beside it, wi&amp; it, as childr&amp;t 



will and do: so that what your father was sayui^ did net tell you 
anything so much as it struck, word by word, the resonant strings 
of remembering. You had been here before, seen these graves more 
than once in the rambling expeditions of boyhood whose aim was 
more than the mere hunting of game, just as you had seen the old 
house too, been familiar with how it would look before you even 
saw it, became large enough logo out there otie day with four or 
five other boys of your size and age and dare one another to evoke 
dte ghost, sitae it would have to be haunted, could not hut he 
haunted although it had stood there empty and unthreatening for 
twenty-six years and nobody to meet or report any ghost, until the 
wagon full of strangers moving fiom Arkansas tried to stop and 
spend the night in it and something happened before thy could be- 
gin to unload th wagon even. What it was they did not or could 
not or would not tell but it had them hack in th wagon, and th 
mules going back down th drive at a gallop, all in about ten 
minutes, not to stop until thy reached Jefferson. You have seen 
ih rotting shll of th house widt its sagging portico and scaling 
walls, its sagging blinds and plank-shuttered windows, set in the 
middle of th domain which had reverted to th state and had been 
bought and sold and bought and sold again and again and rgam. 
No, you were not listening; you didn*t have to: then the dogs 
shred, rose; you looked up and sure enough, just as your father 
had said h would. Luster had hdted th mule and th two horses 
m th rain ^outfifiy yards from th cedars, sitting there with his 
krtees drawn up under th towsadt and enclosed by th cloudy vapor 
of th streaming animals as though h were looking at you and your 
father out of some lugffbrious and painless-purgatory. 'Come on in 
out of th rain. Luster/ your father sdd. ‘I wont let the old Col- 
onel hurt you'— -‘Yawl come m and less go home/ Luster saU. 
*Autt no more hunting today*— We U get wet/ yowefadm said. 

tell you what: well tide on over to that old huse. We can 
foep good and dry dtere/ But IM^ dih$*t budge , Mng thre in 



the rain end inventing reasons not to go to the house — th&lt;U the roof 
would leak or th&lt;a you would all three catdi cold with no jire or 
that you tvould all get so wet before you reached it that dte best 
thing to do would be to go straight home: and your father laughing 
at Luster hut you not laughing so much because even though you 
were not black like Luster was, you were not any older, and you 
and Luster had both been there that day when the five of you, the 
five hoys all of an age, began daring one another to enter the house 
long before you reached it, coming up from the rear, into the old 
street of the slave quarters — a jungle of sumach and persimmon and 
briers and honeystukle, and the rotting piles of what had once been 
log walls and stone chimneys and shingle roofs among the under- 
growth except one, that one; you coming up to it; you didn’t see 
the old woman at all at first because you were watching the boy, 
the Jim Bond, the hulking slack-mouthed scddle-colored boy a few 
years older and bigger than you were, in patched and faded yet 
quite dean shirt and overalls too small for him, working in the 
garden patch beside the cabin: so you didn’t even know she was 
there until cdl of you started and whirled as one and found her 
watehing you from a chair tilted back against the cabin watt— a 
little dried-up woman not much bigger titan a mofdeey and who 
migk have been my ageupteten thousand years, in faded vol- 
ummous skirts and m immaculate hecdrag, h^ hare cojee-colored 
feet wrapped around the chair rung like monkeys do, smoking a 
day pipe and watching you with eyes like two shoe buttons buried 
in the myriad wrinkles of her coffee&lt;oloredface, who Just looked 
at you and said wititout even removing the pipe and in a voice al- 
most like a white womans: *Wkat do you want?’ and afier a 
moment one of you said ^Nothing’ and thm you were cdl rurming 
without knowing which of you began to run first nor why since 
you were not xared, back across the fallow and rairt-gutted and 
bder-choked old fields until you came to the old renting snedee fence 
md crossed tjf, hmied yomxtves over it, and tim tim earth, tine 
214 



land, the sky and trees and woods, looked different a^ain, all right 
again 

“Yes,” Qaentin said. 

•And that was the one Luster was talhing about now,'* 
Shrcve said. “And your father watching you again because 
you hadn t heard the name before, hadn’t even thought that 
he must have a name that day when you saw him in the 
vegetable patch, and you said, ‘Who? Jim what?’ and Luster 
said. Das him. Bright-colored boy whut stay wid dat ole 
woman’ and your father still watching you and you said, 
‘Spell it’ and Luster said, ‘Dat’s a lawyer word. Whut dey 
puts you under when de Law ketches you. I des spells readin’ 
words.’ And that was him, the name was Bond now% and he 
wouldn’t care about that, who had inherited what he was 
from his mother and only what he could never have been 
from his father. And if your father had asked him if he was 
Charles Bon’s son he not only would not have known either, 
he wouldn’t have cared: and if you had told him he was, it 
would have touched and then vanished from what you (not 
he) would have had to call his mind long before it could have 
set up any reaction at all, cither of pride or pleasure, anger or 
grief?” 

“Yes,” Quentin said. 

“And he lived in that cabin behind the haunted house for 
twenty-six years, he and the old woman who must be more 
dian seventy now yet who had no white hair under that 
headrag, whose flesh had hot sagged but looked instead like 
she had grown old up to a certain point just like normal 
people do, then had stopped, and instead of turning gray and 
soft she had begim to shrink so that the skin of her face and 
hands broke into a million tiny cross-hair wrinkles and her 
body just grew smaller and smaller like something being 
shnmk in a ftimace, like the Botnese do thdr captured heads

—who might well have been the ghost if one was ever 
needed, if anybody ever h«i so little else to do as to prowl 
around the house, whidi there was not; if there could have 
been anydung in it to protect from prowlers, which ihace 
was not; if there had I%en any one of them left to hide or 
need concealment in it, which there was not. And yet this 
old gal, this Aunt Rosa, told you that some one was hiding 
om there and you said it was Clyde or Jim Bond and she said 
No and you said it would have to be because the demon was 
dead and Judiuh was dead and Bon was dead and Henry ^ne 
so far he hadn’t even left a grave: and ^e said No and so you 
Went out there, drove the twelve miles at night in a buggy 
and you found Clyde and ^ Bond both m it and you said 
You see? and she (the Aunt Rosa) still said No and so you 
went on: and there was?” 

“Yes.” 

“Wait then,” Shreve said. “For God’s sake watt.” 



* VII * 


J. here was no snow on Shreve’s arm now, no sleeve 
on his arm at all now: only the smoodi cupid-fleshed forearm 
and hand coming back into the lamp and taking a pipe from 
the empty coffre can where he kept them, fiUing it and 
lighting it. So it is zero outside, Quentin thought; soon he 
will raise the window and do deep-breathing in it, dcnch- 
frsted and naked to the waist, in the warm and rosy orifrce 
above the iron quad. But he had not done so yet, and now 
the moment, the thought, was an hour past and the pipe lay 
smoked out and overturned and cold, with a light sprinkling 
of ashes about it, on the table before Shreve’s crossed pink 
bright-haired arms while he watdied Quentin from behind 
the two opaque and lamp-glared moons of his spatades. 
“So he just wanted a grandson,” Shieve said. “That was all 
he was after. Jesus, the South is fine, isn’t it. It’s better than 
the theatre, isn’t it. It’s better than Ben Hur, isn’t it. No 
wonder you have to come away now and then, isn’t it.” 

Quentin did not answer. He sat quite still, facing the table, 
his hands lying on dther side of the open teict book on which 
die letter rested: the rectangle of paper folded across the mid- 
dle and now open, three quarter open, whose bulk had 
raised half itself by the lever^e of the old crease in weight- 
less and paradoidtii levitation, lying at such an angle that he 
could not possibly have read it, dedphercd it, even without 
this added distortion. Yet he toemed to be looking at it, or 

217 



as near as Shreve c»uld tell, he was, his face lowered a litde, 
brooding, almost sullen. “He told Grandfather about it,” he 
said. “That time when the architect escaped, tried to escape 
into the river bottom and go back to New Orleans or wher- 
ever it was, and he ” (“The demon, hey&gt;” Shreve said. 

Quentin did not answer him, did not pause, his voice level, 
curious, a little dreamy yet still with that overtone of sullen 
bemusement, of smoldering outrage: so that Shreve, still too, 
resembling in his spectacles and nothing else (from the waist 
down the table concealed him; so anyone entering the room 
would have taken him to be stark naked) a baroque efSgy 
created out of colored cake dough by someone with a faindy 
nightmaridi affinity for the perverse, watched him with 

thoughtful and intent curiosity.) “ and he sent word in 

to Grandfrthcr,” Quentin said, “and some others and got his 
dogs and his wild niggers out and hunted die architea down 
and made him take earth in a cave under the river bank two 
days later. Ihat was in the second summer, whai they had 
finished all the brick and had the fiiundadons laid and most 
of the big timbers cut and trimmed, and one day the architect 
couldn’t stand it anymore or he was afinid he would starve 
or that the wild niggers (and maybe Colonel Sutpen too) 
wouU run out of grub and eat him or maybe he got home- 
sick or maybe he just had to go (“Maybe he had a 

girl,” Shreve said. “Or maybe he just wanted a You said 
die demon md the niggers didn’t have but two.” Quentin 
did not answer this dther; ag^ he might not have heard, 
talking in that curious repressed calm voice as though to 
the table befine him or the hook upon it or the ktter upcm 
the bo(^ or his hands lying on either ade of the book.) 

“ and so he went. He seemed to vanish in broad day- 

ii^t, right out fixim the middle of twenty-one people. Or 
maybe it vras ju^ Sntpen’s back diat was turned, md dwt 
aii8 



the niggers saw him go and didn’t think it needed mention- 
ing; that being wUd men tiey probably didn’t know what 
Sutpen himself was up to and him naked in the mud with 
them all day. So I reckon the niggers never did knovr what 
the architect was there for, supposed to do or had done or 
could do or was, so maybe they thought Sutpen had sent 
him, told him to go away and drown himself, go away and 
die, or maybe just go away. So he did, jumped up in broad 
daylight, in his embroidered vest and Fauntleroy tie and a hat 
like a Baptist congressman and probably carrying the hat in 
his hand, and ran into the swamp and the niggers watched 
him out of sight and then went back to work and Sutpen 
didn’t even miss him until night, suppertime probably, and 
the niggers told Iiim and he declared a holiday tomorrow 
because he would have to gpt out and borrow some dogs. 
Not that he would have needed dogs, with his niggers to 
trail, but maybe he thought that the guests, the others, would 
not be used to trailing with niggers and would expect dogs. 
And Grandfather (he was young then too) brought some 
champagne and some of the others brought whiskey and 
they began to gather out there a litde after sundown, at Sut* 
pen’s house that didn’t even have walls yet, that wasn’t any- 
thing yet but some lines of bricks sunk into the ground but 
that was all right because they didn’t go to bed anyhow, 
Grandfether said. They just sat around the fire with the 
champagne and the whiskey and a quarter of the last venison 
Sutpen had killed, and about midnight the man with the 
dogs came. Then it was daylight and the dogs had a litde 
trouble at first because some of the wild niters had run out 
about a mile of the trail just for fun. But they got the trail 
straightened out at last, the dogs and the niggers in the bot- 
tom and most of the men tiding along the edge of it where 
the going was good. But Grand&amp;ther and Colonel Sutpen 

319 



went witii tiie dogs and die niggers boaose Sutpea was 
afraid die niggas might catch the architea before he could 
reach them. He and Grandfather had to walk a good deal, 
sending one of the niggers to lead the hors^ on around the 
bad places until they could ride again. Grandfather said it 
was fine weather and the trail lay pretty good but Sufpen 
said it would have been fine if the architect had just waited 
and! October or November. And so he toU Grandfrther 
something about himself 

“Sutpen’s trouble was innocence. All of a sudden he dis- 
covered, not what he wanted to do but what he just had to 
do, had to do it whether he wanted to or not, because if he 
did not do it he knew that he could never live with himself 
for the rest of his life, never live with what all the men and 
women that had died to make him had left inside of him fer 
him to pass on, with all the dead ones waiting and watching 
to see if he was going to do it right, fix things right so that 
he would be able to look in the face not only the old dead 
ones but all the living ones that would come afrer him wh^ 
he would be one of the dead And that at the vary moment 
when Iffi discovered what it was, he found out that this was 
the last thing in the world he was equipped to do because he 
not only had . not known that he would have to do this, he 
&lt;hd not even know that it existed to he wanted, to need to 
be done, imdl he was almost fourteen years old Because he 

was bom in West Virginia, in the mountains (“Not 

in West Virginia,” Shreve said ^“Whatt” Quentin said 

“Not in Wrat Virgmia,” Shreve said “Because if he was 
twenty-five years old in Mississippi in 1833, he was bom in 
1808. And there wasn’t any West Virgink in 1808 because

admitted •” “All r^gjtt all right,” Quentin said “

right,” Quentin said.) “ ^he was bom where what few 

other people he knew lived in log cabins boiling with dbE- 
dren like the one he was bom in — ^mcn and grown boys who 
hunted or lay before the fire on the floor while the women 
and older girls stepped back and forth across them to readi 
the fire to cook, where the only colored people were Indians 
and you only looked down at them over your rifle sights, 
where he had never even heard of, never imagined, a place, 
a land divided neatly up and actually owned by men who did 
nothing but ride over it on fine horses or sit in fine clothes on 
the galleries of big houses while other people worked for 
them; he did not even imagine then that there was any such 
way to live or to want to live, or that there existed all the 
objects to be wanted which there were, or that the ones who 
owned the objects not only could look down on the ones 
that didn’t, but could be supported in the down-looking not 
only by the others who owned objects too but by die very 
ones that were looked down on that didn’t own objects and 
knew they never would. Because where he lived the land 
belonged to anybody and everybody and so the man who 
would go to the trouble and work to &amp;nce oC a piece of it 
and say *This is mine’ was crazy; and as for objects, nobody 
had any more of them than you did because everybody had 
just what he was strong oxot^h or energetic enough to take 
and keep, and only that crazy man would go to the trouble 
to take or even want more than he could eat or swap for 
powder and whiskey. So he didn’t even know dwre was a 
country all divided and fixed and neat with a people living 
on it dl divided and fixed and neat because of what color 
their skins happened to be and what they happened to own, 
ami where a certain few men not only had the power of life 
9nd d»th and barter and sale over cAers, but they had liv- 
ing human men to p^ferm Ac endless repetitive pet^mal 



offices, such as pouring the very whiskey from the jug and 
putting the glass into a man’s hand or pulling off boots 
for him to go to bed, that all men have had to do for them- 
selves sina time began and would have to do until they died 
and which no man ever has or ever will like to do, but which 
no man that he knew had ever thought of evading anymore 
than he had thought of evading the effort of chewing and 
swallowing and breathing. When he was a child he ffidn’t 
listen to the vague and doudy tales of Tidewater splendor 
that penetrated even his mountains because then he could not 
understand what the people who told about it meant, and 
when he became a boy he didn’t listen to them because there 
was nothing in right to compare and gauge the tales by and 
so give the words life and meaning, and no chance that he 
ever would understand what they meant because he was too 
busy doing the tilings that boys do; and when he got'to be a 
youth and curiosity itself ediumed the tales which he did not 
know he had heard and speculated on, he was interested and 
would have liked to see the places once, but without envy 
or hecaose he just thought that some people were 
spawned in one place and some in another, some ^wned 
(lucky, he may have called it) and some not, and tiiat 
(so he told Grandfather) the mm themselves had Httie to do 
with the chooring and less of the regret because it had never 
once occurred to him that any man should take any such 
blind acddent as that as authority or warrant to look down 
at otheo, any others. So he had hardly heard of such a woiM 
until he foil into it. 

“That’s how it was. They into it^ the whofe fanuly, 
retumol to the coast from whidb. the first Su^en had come 
(when the ship fiom the Old Bailey teach^ Jamestown 
probably), tumbled head over heels back to Tidswatear by 
tiiecr aititodei, elevation and gtavity, as if whatever sh^ hoU 



tte family had had on the mountain had broken. He said 
something to Grandfather about his mother d)ing about that 
time and how his pap said she was a fine wear^^mg woman 
and that he would miss her; and something about how it 
was the v/ife that had got his father even that far West. And 
now the whole passel of them from the father through the 
grown daughters down to one that couldn’t even walk yet, 
slid back down out of the mountains, skating in a kind of 
accelerating and sloven and inert coherence like a useless col- 
lection of flotsam on a flooded river, moving by some per- 
verse automotivation such as inanimate objects sometimes 
show, backward against the very current of the stream, 
across the Virginia plateau and into the slack lowlands about 
the mouth of the James River. He didn’t know why they 
moved, or didn’t remember the reason if he ever knew it — 
whether it was optimism, hope in his father s breast or nos- 
talgia, since he didn’t know just where his father had come 
firom, whether from the country to which they returned or 
not, or even if his father knew, remembered, wanted to re- 
member and find it again. He didn’t know whether some- 
body, some traveler, had told him of some easy place or time, 
some escape from the hardship of getting food and keeping 
warm in the mountain way, or if perhaps somebody his fa- 
ther knew once or who knew his father once and remembered 
hi m, happened to think about him, or someone kin to him 
who had tried to forget him and couldn’t quite do it, had 
sent for him and he had obeyed, going not for the promised 
job but for the ease, having faith perhaps in the blood kin- 
ship to evade the labor, if it was kinship and in his own in- 
ertia and in whatever gods had watched over him this far if 

it were not. But all he remembered (“The demon,” 

Shreve said) “ was that one morning the father rose and 

told the older girls to pack what food they had, and some- 

223 



body wrapped up the baby and somebody else threw water 
on die fire and Aey walked down the mountain to where 
roads existed. They had a lopsided two wheeled cart and two 
spaviied oxen now. He toH Grandfather he did not re- 
manber just where nor when nor how his fether had got it. 
Hfe was tel then; the two older boys had left home some time 
before and had not beaa heard of since. He droire the oxen, 
since almost as soon as they got the cart his fiither began the 
practice of accomplishing that part of the translation devoted 
to m otion fiat on his back in the cart, oblivious among the 
quilts and lanterns and well buckets and bundles of clothing 
and diildren, snoring with alcohol That was how he told it. 
He didn't remember if it was weeks or months or a year they 
travded, except that one of the older girls who had left the 
cabin unmarried was still unmarried when they finally stop- 
ped, though she had become a mother before they lost the 
last blue mountain range, ffe didn't remember whether it 
was that winter and then spring and then s umme r that over- 
took and passed them on the road, or vdietfaer they overtook 
and passed in dow succe^on the seasons as they descended, 
or whetho' it was the descent itself that did it, and they not 
pn^resh^ parallel in time but descending peipendiafiarly 
through temperattire and dimate—a (you couldn't call it a 
period because as he remembered it or as he told Grand- 
fother he did, k didn’t have either a definite he^mmg or a 
definite ending. Maybe attenuation is better) — ^aa attenua- 
tion fiom a kind of furious inertness and patient immobility, 
while they sat in the cart outside die doors of dowries and 
taverns and waited for the fodter to drfok himself insensibie, 
to a sort of dreamy and destinationless locomotion after diley 
had ^t die old man out of whatever shed or outhouse or 
barn or ditch and foaded him into the cart a^in, and duihig 

whidh they dH nc^ seten to progr^ itt all Wjust to hang 

' 



suspended while the earth itself altered, flattened and broad- 
ened out of the mountain cove where they had all been bom, 
mounting, rising about them like a tide in which the strange 
harsh rough faces about the doggery doors into which the 
old man was just entering or was just being carried or thrown 
out (and this one time by a huge bull of a nigger, the first 
black man, slave, they had ever seen, who emerged with the 
old man over his shoulder like a sack of meal and his — ^the 
nigger’s — mouth loud with laughing and full of teeth like 
tombstones) swam up and vamshed and were replaced; the 
earth, the world, rising about them and flowing past as if the 
cart moved on a treadmill. And it was now spring and now 
summer and they still were moving on toward a place they 
had never seen and had no conception of, let alone wanted 
to go to; and from a place, a litdc lost spot on the side of 
a hill back to which probably not one of them could have 
led the way — excepting possibly the usually insensible father 
who made one stage of the journey accompanied by the 
raspberry-colored elephants and snakes which he seems to 
have been hunting-bringing into and then removing firom 
their sober static country astonishment the strange faces and 
places, both faces and places— doggeries and taverns now be- 
come hamlets, hamlets now become villages, villages now 
towns, and the country flattened out now with good roads 
and fields and niggers working in die fields while white men 
sat finfl horses and watched them, and more fine horses and 
men in fine clothes, with a different look in the face from 
mountain men about the taverns where the old man was not 
even allowed to come in by the front door and firom which 
his mountain drinking manners got him ejected before he 
would have time to get drunk good (so that now they began 
to make really pretty good time) and no laughter and jeers 

225 



to the ejasing now, even if the kogJiter and had been 
harsh and without much gentleness in them. 

“That’s the way he got it. He had learned the difference 
not only between white men and blade ones, but he was 
leamii^ that there was a difference between white men and 
white men, not to be measured by lifting anvils or gouging 
eyes or how much whiskey you could drink then get up and 
walk out of the room. He had begun to disesm that without 
being aware of it yet- He still thought that that was just a 
matter of where you were spawned and how; whether you 
were lucky or not lucky; and that the lucky ones would be 
even slower and leather than the unlucky to take any advan- 
tage of it or credit for it, or to feel that it gave them anything 
more than the luck; and he still thought that they would feci 
if anything more tender toward the unlucky dban the im- 
lucky would ever need to fed toward them. He was to find 
all that out later. He remembered when he found it out, 
because that was the same second whai he discovered his in- 
nocence. It was not the second, the moment, that he was long 
about: it was the getting to it: the moment when they must 
have realized, believed at last diat they were no longer travd- 
ing, moving, going somewhere— not the being still at last 
and in a feshion settled, because they had done that before on 
the road; he remembered how one time the gradual difier- 
euffi in comfort between the presence and absence of shoes 
and warm dothing occurred in one place: a cowshed where 
the sister’ s baby was bom and, as he told Grandfather, fijr all 
he could remember, concaved too. Because they were stop- 
ped now at last He didn’t know where they were. For a 
time, during the first days or wedcs or months, the woods- 
man’s instinct which he had acquired firam the environment 
wlKxe he grew up or that maybe had been bequeathed him 
by the two laothers who had varoshed, one of whom had 

S26 



been as far West as the Mississippi River one timft — ^the in- 
stinct bequeathed him along with the wom-out buckskin 
garments and sudh which they left in the cabin when they 
departed die last time for goo4 and which he had sharpened 
by boy’s practice at small game and such — kept him oriented 
so that he could have (so he said) found his way back to the 
mountain cabin in time. But that w’as past now, behind him 
the moment when he last could have said exaedy where he 
had been bom. He was now weeks and months, maybe a 
year, since he became confused about his age and was never 
able to straighten it out again, so that he told Grandfather 
that he did not know within a year on either side just how 
old he was. So he knew neither where he had come from 
nor where he was nor why. He was just there, surrounded by 
the faces, almost all the faces which he had ever known 
(though the number of them was decreasing, thinning out, 
despite the efforts of the unmarr^d sister who pretty soon, 
so he told Grandfather, and still without any weddhig had 
another baby, decreasing because of the climate, the warmth, 
the dampness) hving in a cabin that was almost a replica of 
the mountain one except that it didn’t sit up m the bright 
wind but sat instead beside a big flat river that sometimes 
showed no current at all and even sometimes ran backward, 
where his sisters and brothers seemed to take sick after sup- 
per and die before the next meal, where regiments of nig- 
gers with white men watdiing them planted and raised things 
that he had never heard of. The old man did something be- 
sides drink now, at least, he would leave the cabm after break- 
fast and return sober to supper, and he fed them somehow. 
And the man was there who owned all the land and the nig- 
gers and apparently the white men who superintended the 
work, and who lived in die biggest house he had ever seen 
and who spent most of the afternoon ^e told how he would 

227 



creep up among the tangled shrubbery of the lawn and Iiu 
bidden and watch the man) in a barrel stave hammodc be- 
tween two trees, with his shoes off, and a n^ger who worn 
every day better clothes than he or his &amp;ther and sisters had 
ever owned and ever expected to, who did nothing else but 
fin him and bring him drinks. And he (he was eleven or 
twelve or thirteen now because this was where he realized 
dmt he had irrevocably lost count of his age) would He there 
all afternoon while the sisters would come from time to time 
to the door of die cabin two miles away and scream at hitn 
for wood or water, watching that man who not only had 
shoes in the summertime too, but didn’t even have to wear 
them. 

“But he still didn’t oivy the man he was watching. He 
coveted the shoes, and probably be would have liked for his 
fither to have a broadcloth monkey to hand him the jug and 
to carry the wood and water into the cabin for his sisters to 
wash and cook with and keep the house warm so that he him- 
self would not have to do it. Maybe he even realized, under- 
stood the pleasure k would have given his sisters for th«r 
neighbors (other whites like them, who Hved in other cabins 
not quite as well built and not at all as well kept and pre- 
served as the ones the n%ger slaves Hved in but still nimbused 
with freedom’s bright auta, which the slave quarters were 
not for all their sound roofi and whitewash) to see them be- 
ing waited on. Because he had not only not lost the kmocaice 
yeti he had not yet discovo:^ that he possessed k. He no 
mote envied the man than he would have envied a mountain 
man who happened to own a fine rifle. He would have cov- 
eted the rifle, but he woidd himself have supported and 
confirmed the owner’s pikle and pleasure in its owasisbip 
becitose he cooU not have conceived of the owner, takkig 
mk crass advantage of the luck whkh gave the rifle to him 
2ZB . 



rather than to another as to say to other men: Because I own 
this rifie^ my arms and legs and blood and bones are superior to 
yotirs except as the victorious outcome of a fight with rifles: 
and how in die world could a man fight another man with 
dressed-up niggers and the fact that he could lie in a ham- 
mock all afternoon with his shoes off? and what in the world 
would he he fighting tor if he did? He didn’t even know he 
was innocent that day when his father sent him to the big 
house with the message. He didn’t remember (or did not 
say) what the message ■w'as, apparently he still didn’t know 
exactly just what his father did (or maybe was supposed to 
do), what work the old man had m relation to the plantauon. 
He was a boy either thirteen or fourteen, he didn’t know 
which, in garments his father had got from the plantation 
commissary and had worn out and which one of tlie sisters 
had patched and cut down to fit him, and he was no more 
conscious of his appearance in them or of the possibility that 
anyone else would be than he was of his skin, following the 
road and turning mto the gate and following tlie drive up 
past where still more niggers with nothing to do all day but 
plant flowers and trim grass were working, and so to the 
house, the portico, the front door, thinking how at last he 
was going to see the inside of it, see what else a man was 
bound to own who could have a spcdal nigger to hand him 
his liquor and pull off his shoes that he didn’t even need to 
wear, never for one moment thinking but what the man 
would be as pleased to show him the balance of his things as 
the mountain man would have been to show the powder 
horn and bullet mold that went with the rifle. Because he 
was still innocent. He knew it without being aware that he 
did; he told Grandfather how, before the monkey n%ger 
who came to the door had finished saying what he said, he 
seemed to kind of dissolve and a part of him turn and nidi 



ba(^ througk tke two years they had lived there, like when 
you pass through a room fast and look at all the objects in it 
and yon turn and go back through the room again and look 
at all the objaas from the other side and you find out you 
had never seen them before, rushing back through those two 
years and seeing a doKn things that had happened and he 
hadn’t even seen them before: the certain flat level silent way 
his older sisters and the od^ white women of their kind had 
of looking at n%^rs, not with fear or dread but with a kind 
of speculative antagonism not because of any known feet or 
reason but inherited, by both white and bladk, the sense, 
effluvium of it passing between the white women in the 
doors of the sagging cabins and the niggers in the road and 
which was not quite explainable by the fact that the aggers 
had better clothes, and which the niggers did not return as 
antagonism or in any sense of dare or taunt but through the 
very feet that they were apparently oblivious of it, too ob- 
livious of it. You knew diat you could hit them, he told 
Grandfether, and they would not hit back or even resist. But 
you did not want to, because they (the niggers) were not it, 
not what you wanted to hit; that you knew when you hit 
them you would just be hitting a duld’s toy balloon with a 
free painted on it, a fece slick and smooth and distended and 
about to burst into laughing, and so you did not dare strike 
it because it would merely burst and you would rather let it 
walk on out of your sight than to have stood there in the 
load laughing. He remembered talk at night before the fire 
whtai they had company or had dtemslves gone visiting 
after supper to another cabin, the voices of the women sober 
enough, even calm, yet filled with a quality daric and suBen 
and only some man, usually his father in drink, to break out 
into harsh recapitulation ofhis own worth, the reject which 
his own physical prowess commanded from his fellows, and 
230 



the boy of either thirteen or fourteen or maybe twelve 
Imowing that the men and the women were talking about 
the same thing though it had never once been mentioned by 
name, as when people talk about privation without men- 
tioning the siege, about sickness without ever naming the 
epidemic. He remembered one afternoon when he and his 
sister were walking along the road and he heard the carnage 
coming up behind them and stepped off the road and then 
realized that his sister was not going to give way to it, that 
she still walked in the middle of the road with a sort of sullen 
implacabihty in the very angle of her head and he shouted at 
her: and then it was all dust and rearing horses and ghntuig 
harness buckles and wheel spokes; he saw two parasols m the 
carriage and the nigger coachman in a plug hat shoutmg: 
‘Hoo dar, gal' Git outen de way dar!’ and then it was over, 
gone; the carri^e and the dust, the two faces beneath the 
parasols glaring down at his sister; then he was throwmg vain 
clods of dirt after the dust as it spun on. He knew now, while 
the monkey-dressed nigger butler kept the door barred with 
his body while he spoke, that it had not been the nigger 
coachman that he threw at at all, that it was the actual dust 
raised by the proud delicate wheels, and just that vain. He 
thought of one night late when his father came home, 
blundered into the cabin; he could smeE the whiskey even 
while still dulled with broken sleep, hearing that same fierce 
exultation, vindication, in his fether’s voice; ‘We whupped 
one of Pettibone’s niggers tonight* and he roused at diat, 
waked at diat, asking which one of Pettibone’s niggers and 
his father said he did not know, had never seen the nigger 
before: and he asked what die nigger had done and his father 
said, ‘Hell fire, that goddam son of a bitch Pettibone’s nig- 
ger.’ He must have meant the question the same way his 
feher meant the answer without knowing it then, since he 

231 



had not yet discovered innocence: no actual niggetj living 
creature, living flesh to feel pain and writhe and cry out He 
could even seem to see them: the tordi-disturbed darkness 
among trees, the fierce hysterical faces of the white men, the 
balloon face of the nigger. Maybe the nigger’s hands would 
be tied or held but that would be all r%ht because they were 
not the hands with which the balloon face would struggle and 
writhe for freedom, not the balloon face: it was just poised 
among diem, levitative and slick with paper-thin distension. 
Then someone would strike the balloon one single desperate 
and despairing blow and then he would seem to see them 
fledng, running, with all about them, overtaking them and 
passing and going on and then returning to overwhelm them 
again, the roaring waves of mellow laughter meaningless and 
terrifying and loud. And now he stood there before that 
white door with the monkey nigger barring it and looking 
down at him in his patched made-over jeans clothes and no 
shoes, and I dont reckon he had even ever experimmted with 
a comb because that would be one of the things that his 
sisters would keep hidden good. He had never thought about 
his own hair or dothes or anybody dse’s hair or dothes until 
he saw that monkey nigger, who through no doing of his 
own happened to have h^ the fdicity of being houselued 
in Richmond maybe, looking — ('*Or maybe even in Charles- 
ton,” Shreve breathed.) at them and he never even 

tememhered what the nigger said, how it was the nigger toH 
him, evai before he had had time to say what he came for, 
never to come to that firont door again but to go around to 
thebacL 

“He didn’t eveai remember leaving. All of a sudden he 
found himself running and already some distance firom the 
house, and not toward home. He was not cryid^, he said. He 
wasn’t even mad. He just had to think, so he was goir^ to 
332 



■where he could be quiet and think, and he knew where that 
place was. He went into the woods. He says he did not tell 
himself -where to go: that his body, his feet, just went there 
— z place where a game trail entered a canebrake and an oak 
tree had fallen across it and made a kind of cave where he 
kept an iron griddle that he would cook small game on 
sometimes. He said he crawled back into the cave and sat 
■with his back against the uptom roots, and thought. Because 
he couldn’t get it straight yet. He couldn’t even realize yet 
diat his trouble, his impediment, was innocence because he 
would not be able to reaKze that until he got it straight. So 
he was seeking among what httle he had to call experience 
for something to measure it by, and he couldn’t find any- 
thing. Hfe had been told to go around to the back door even 
before he could state his errand, who had sprung from a 
people whose houses didn’t have back doors but only 'win- 
dows and anyone entering or leaving by a -window would 
be either hidmg or escaping, neither of which he was doing. 
In f^t, he had actually come on business, in the good faith of 
business which he had believed that all men accepted. Of 
course he had not expected to be invited in to eat a meal 
since time, the distance from one cooking pot to the next, 
did not need to be measured in hours or days; perhaps he had 
not expected to be asked into the house at alL But he did ex- 
pect to be listened to because he had come, been sent, on 
some business which, even though he didn’t remember what 
it -was and maybe at the time (he said) he might not even 
have comprehended, 'was certainly connected somehow with 
the plantation that supported and endured that smooth white 
house and that smooth white brass-decorated door and the 
very broaddoth and linen and silk stockings the monkey 
nigger stood in to tell him to go around to die back before 
he could even state the busiuess. It was hke he might Ime 

Z3$ 



been sent vndi a lump of lead or even a few molded bullets 
so diat the man vsfho owned die fine rifle could shoot it, and 
the man came to the door and told him to leave the bullets 
on a stump at the edge of the woods, not even letting him 
come dose enough to look at the rifle. 

“Because he was not mad. He inristed on that to Grand- 
&amp;then He was just thinking, because he knew that some- 
thing would have to be done about it; he would have to do 
something about it in order to live with himself for the rest 
of his life and he could not decide what it was because of that 
innocence whkh he had just discovered he had, which (the 
innocence, not the man, the tradition} he would have to 
compete with. He had nothing to compare and gauge it by 
but die rifle analogy, and it would not make sense by that. 
He was quite calm about it, he said, sitting there with his 
arms around his knees in his littk den beside the game trail 
vdiere more than once when the wind was right he had seen 
deer pass within ten feet of him, arguing with himself quietly 
and calmly while both debaters agreed that if there were 
only som^me else, some older and smarter person to ask. 
But there was not, there vm only himsdfi the two of them 
inside that one body, arguing quiet and calm: But I can 
^mt him. (Not the monkey n%ger. It vm not the ni^^r 
anymore than it had bem the n^;^ that his fether had 
hdped to whip that night. The ni^er was just another bal- 
loon fece slick and distended with that mellow loud and 
terrible laughing so that he did not dare to burst it^ looking 
down at him firom within the halfidosed door during that 
instant in whkh, before he knew itv something in him had 
escaped and— he unaHe to dose the eyes of it— was looking 
out firom within the balloon fiux just as the man who did 
not even have to wear the shoes he owned, whom the laugh- 
ter which, the balloon hdd barricaded and protected firom

such as he, looked out from whatever invisible place he (the 
man) happened to be at the moment, at the boy outside the 
barred door in his patched garments and splayed bare feet, 
looking through and beyond the boy, he himself seeing his 
own father and sisters and brothers as the owner, the rich 
man (not the nigger) must have been seeing them ail the 
time — as cattle, creatures heavy and without grace, brately 
evacuated into a world without hope or purpose for them, 
who would in turn spawn with brutish and vicious prolixity, 
populate, double treble and compound, fill space and earth 
with a race whose future would be a succession of cut-down 
and patched and made-over garments bought on exorbitant 
credit because they were wliite people, from stores where 
niggers were given the garments firee, with for sole heritage 
that expression on a balloon face bursting with laughter 
which had looked out at some unremembered and nameless 
progenitor who had knocked at a door when he was a little 
boy and had been told by a mgger to go around to the back): 
But I can siwot him: he argued with himself and the other: 
No. That wouldn’t do no good: and the first: What shall we do 
then? and the other: I dont hnow: and die first: But I can shoot 
him. I could slip right up there through them bushes and lay there 
until he come out to lay in the hammock and shoot him: and the 
other: No. That wouldn’t do no good: and die first: Then what 
shall we do? and die other; I dont know. 

“Now he was hungry. It was before dinner when he went 
to the big house, and now there was no sun at all where he 
crouched though he could soil see sun in the tops of the trees 
around him. But his stomach had already told him it was 
late and that it would be later stiU when he reached home. 
And then he said he began to think Home. Home and that he 
thought at first that he was trying to laugh and that he kept 
on telling himsdtf’ it was laughing even after he knew better; 

235 



home, as he came out of the woods and approached it, stifl 
hydai yet, and looked at it— the rough pardy rottoi log 
walls, the sagging roof whose missing shingles they did not 
replace bat just set pans and buckets under the leaks, die 
fcan-to room which they used for kitchen and which was all 
right b^use in good weather it didn’t even matter that it 
had no chimney since they did not attempt to use it at all 
when it rained, and his sbter pumping rhythmic up and down 
above a washtub in the yard, her ba^ toward hi^ shapeless 
in a calico dress and a pair of the old man’ s shoes unlaced and 
flapping about her bare ankles and broad in the beam as a 
cow, the very labor she was doing brutish and stupidly out 
of afl proportion to its reward: the very primary essence of 
labor, toik reduced to its crude absolute which only a beast 
could and would endure; and now ^e said) the thought 
striking him for the first time as to what he would tell his 
fiuher when the old man asked him if he had delivered the 
mess^e, whether he would lie or not, since if he did lie he 
would be fiiund out maybe at once, since probably the man 
had already sent a nigger down to see why whatever it was 
his &amp;tha: had &amp;il^ to do was not done, and had smt the 
caccuse fin:— ^tanted that that was what his errand to the 
house had been, whidi (granted his old man) it probahfy 
was. But it didn’t happen at once because his &amp;ther was not 
at home yet So it was only the sister, as if she had been wait- 
ing not for the wood but just for bin to return, fiir die op- 
portunity to use her vocal cords, nagging at him to fetch the 
wood and he not mfiising, not objecting, just not heating 
her, paying any attention to her because be was still tbmking. 
Him the old man came and the rister told on him and the 
old man made him fetch the wood: and sriU nodiing said 
about the .errand while diey ate st^per nor when he wertt 
and lay down on the pallet where he ^t and where he went 



to bed by just lying down, only not to sleep now, just lying 
there with Ins hands under his head and still nothing said 
about it, and he still not knowing if he was going to lie or 
not. Because, he said to Grandfather, the ternble part of it 
had not occurred to him yet, he just lay there while the two 
of them argued inside of him, speaking in orderly turn, both 
calm, even leaning backward to be calm and reasonable and 
unrancorous: BtU I can kill him. — No. That wouldn’t do no 
good — Then what shall we do ahout it? — I dont know: and he 
just listening, not especiaEy interested, he said, hearing the 
two of them without listening. Because what he was think- 
ing about now he hadn’t asked for. It was just there, natural 
in a boy, a child, and he not paying any attention to it either 
because it was what a boy would have thought, and he knew 
that to do what he had to do in order to live with himself he 
would have to think it out stra^ht as a man would, thinking 
The nigger never give me a chance to tell him what it was and so he 
(not the nigger now either) wont know it and wltatever it is 
wont get done and he wont know it aint done until too late so he will 
get paid back that much for what he set titat nigger to do and if it 
only was to tell him that the sttdjle, the house, was on fire and die 
nigger wouldn’t even let me tell him, warn him. And then he said 
that all of a sudden it was not thinking, it was something 
shouting it almost loud enough for his sisters on the other 
pallet and his father in the bed with the two youngest and fill- 
ing the room with alcohol snoring, to hear too: He never even 
give me a chance to say it: it too fost, too naixed up to be think- 
ing, it all kind of shouting at him at once, boiling out and 
over him like the n%ger laughing: He never give me a chance 
to say it and Pap never asked me if I told him or not and so he cant 
even know that Pap sent Jam any message and so whether he got 
it or not emit even matter, not even to Pap; I went up to that door 
for that nigger to tell me never to come to that front door agmn and 

217 



1 not only wasn^t doing my good to him by telling it or my harm 
to him by not tellii^ it, there aint any good or harm either in the 
living world that I can do to Mm. It -was like that, he said, like 
as exploaon— a bright glare that vanished and left nothing, 
no ashes nor refuse; just a limitless flat plain with the severe 
shape of his intact innocence rising from it like a monument; 
fliat innocence instructing him as calm as the others had ever 
spoken, using his own rifle analogy to do it with, and when 
it said them in place of he or him, it meant more than all the 
human puny mortals under the sun that might lie in ham- 
mocks all afternoon with their shoes off: He thought 'If you 
were fixing to combat them that had the fine rifles, the first 
thing you would do would be to get yourself the nearest 
thing to a fine rifle you could borrow or steal or make, 
wouldn’t itj’ and he said Yes. ‘But this aint a question of 
rifles. So to combat them you have got to have what they 
have that made them do what the man did. You got to have 
land and n%gers and a fine house to combat them with. You 
see?’ and he said Yes again. He kft that night He waked be- 
fore day and departed just like he went to bed: by rising 
from the pallet and tiptoeing out of the house. He never saw 
any of his frunily again. 

“He went to the West Indies.” Quenrin had not moved, 
not even to raise his head from its attitade of broodir^ be- 
musement upon the open letter whidi lay on the open text- 
book, his hands lying on the table before him on either side 
of the book and foe letter, one half of which slanted upward 
from foe transverse crease without support, as if it had 
learned half foe secret of levitation. “That was how Sutpen 
said it. He and Grandfrther were sitting on a log now be- 
cauffi foe dogs had fruited. That is, they had treed — z tree 
from which he (foe architect) could not have escaped yet 
which he had rmdoubtedly mounted because they found foe 

238 



sapling pole with his suspenders stiil knotted about one end 
of it that he had used to climb the tree, though at first they 
could not understand why the suspenders, and it was three 
hours before they comprehended that the architect had used 
architecture, physics, to elude them as a man always falls 
back upon what he knows best in a crisis — the murderer 
upon murder, the thief thieving, the liar lying. He (the archi- 
tect) knew about the wild negroes even if he couldn’t have 
known that Sutpen would get dogs; he had chosen that tree 
and hauled that pole up after him and calculated stress and 
distance and trajectory and had crossed a gap to the next 
nearest tree that a flying squirrel could not have crossed and 
traveled from there on from tree to tree for almost half a 
inile before he put foot on the ground again. It was three 
hours before one of the wild niggers (the dogs wouldn’t 
leave the tree; they said he was in it) found where he had 
come down. So he and Grandfather sat on the log and talked, 
and one of the wild niggers went back to camp for grub and 
ihe rest of the whiskey and they blew the other men in with 
horns and they ate, and he told Grandfather some more cd 
it while they waited. 

“He went to the West Indies. That’s how Sutpen said it: 
not how he managed to find where the West Indies were 
nor where ships departed from to go there, nor how he got 
to where the ships were and got in one, nor how he liked the 
sea, nor about the hardships of a sailor’s life and it must have 
been hardship indeed for him, a boy of fourteen or fifteen 
who had never seen the ocean before, going to sea in 1823. 
He just said, ‘So I went to the West Indies,’ sitting there on 
the log with Grandfather while the dogs still bayed the dree 
where they believed the architect was because he would have 
to be there — ^saying it just like that day thirty years later 
when he sat in Grandfather’s office (in his fine clothes now, 

239 



even thougk they were a little soiled and worn with three 
years of war, with money to ratde in his pocket and his 
beard at its prime too: beard, body and intellect at that peak 
which all the different parts that make a man reach, where 
he can say I did all that I set out to do and I could stop here if I 
wanted to &lt;aid no man to chide me with sloth, not even myself— 
and maybe this the instant which Fate always picks out to 
blackjati you, only the peak feels so sound and stable that 
lh.e beginning of the failing is hidden for a little while — say- 
ing it with his head flung up a little in that attitude that no- 
body ever knew exactly who he had aped it from or if he 
did not perhaps leam it too from the same book out of which 
he taught himself the words, the bombastic phrases with 
which Grandfather said he evor asked you fr»r a match for 
his dgar or offered you the cigar — ^and foere was nothing of 
vanity, nothing comic in it either Grandfather said, because 
of that innocence which he had never lost, because after it 
finally told him what to do that night he forgot about it and 
didn’t know that he still had it) and he told Grandfother — 
told him, mind; not excusing, asking for no pity; not ex- 
plaining, asking for no exculpation: just told Grandfrther 
how he had put his first wife aside like deventh- and twdfth- 
coitoty kings did: 1 found that she was not and could never 
be, through no fruit of her own, adjunctive or incremental 
to the design which I had in nhnd, so 1 provided for her and 
put her aide.* — telling Grandfrther in that same tone while 
they sat on die log waiting for the niggos to come back 
with the ofrter guests and the whiskey: ‘So I went to the 
West indies. I had had some xhoolix^ during a part of one 
winter, enough to have learned something about them, to 
realize that they would be most suitable to the expediency 
of my requfrements.’ He didn’t remomber how he came to 
go to the school lhat is, why his frther deddql all c£a sod- 



den to send Mm, what nebulous vision or shape might have 
evolved out of the fog of alcohol and nigger-beating and 
scheming to avoid work v/Mch his old man called his mind 
— the image not of ambition nor glory, not to see Ms son 
better himself for Ms own sake, probably not even some 
blind instant of revolt against that same house whose roof 
had leaked on probably a hundred families Hke Ms wMch had 
come and lived beneath it and vanished and left no trace, 
nothing, not even rags and broken crockery, hut was prob- 
ably mere tindktive envy toward one or two men, planters, 
whom he had to see every now and then. Anyway, he was 
sent to school for about three months one winter— an ado- 
lescent boy of thirteen or fourteen in a room full of children 
three or four years younger than he and dhree or four years 
further advanced, and he not only probably bigger than the 
teardier (the kind of teadher that would be teaching a one- 
room country school in a nest of Tidewater plantations) but 
a good deal more of a man, who probably brought into the 
school with him along with Ms sober watchful mountain re- 
serve a good deal of latent insubordination diat he would 
not be aware of any more than he would he aware at first 
that the teacher was afiMd of Mm. It would not be intractar- 
hUhy and maybe you couldn*t call it pride either, but maybe 
just the selfi-reiiance of mountains and solitude, since some of 
Ms blood at least 0 ns mother was a mountain woman, a 
Scottyi woman who, so he told Grandfafber, never did 
quite leam to speak English) had been bred in mountains, but 
wMch,. whatever it was, was that wMch forbade Mm to con- 
descend to memorize dry sums and such but which did per- 
mit Mm to listen when dffi teacher -read alctad. — Sent to 
sch(^ \9he1e,* he told Grandfatheii ‘I learned little save 
&lt;h^ most of the ^eds, good and had both, incurring oppro- 
britan car ptediis or reward either, within the scope of man’s 

341 



abilities, bad already been performed and were to be learned 
about only from books. So I listened wl^ he would read 
to us. I retlize now that on mc»t of these occasions he re- 
sorted to reading aloud only when he saw that the moment 
had come when his entire school was on die point of rising 
and leaving the room. But whatever the reason, he read to us 
and I anyway listened, thou^ I did not know that in that 
listening I was equipping myself better for what I should 
later design to do than if I had learned all the addition and 
subtraction in the book. That was how I learned of the West 
Indies. Not where they were, though if I had known at die 
time that that knowledge would someday serve me, I would 
have learned that too. What I learned was that there was a 
place called the West Indies to which poor men went in 
ships and became rich, it didn’t matter how, so long as that 
man was clever and courageous: the latter of which I be- 
lieved that I possessed, the former of which I believed that, 
if it were to be learned by energy and will in the sdiool of 
endeavor and experience, I should leam. I remember how 1 
remained one afremoon when school was out and waited for 
the teacher, waylaid him; he was a smallish man who always 
looked dusty, as if he had been bom and lived all his hfo in 
attics and store rooms. I recall how he started back when he 
saw me and how I thought at the time that if I were to strike 
him there would he no resulting outcry but merely the sound 
of the blow and a puff of dust in the air as when you strike a 
rug hanging from a line. I asked him if it were true, if what 
he had read us about the men who got rich in the West 
Indies were true. “Why not?” he answered, starting bade. 
“Didn’t you hear me read it from the book?” — “How do I 
know that what you read was in the book?” I said. I was that 
gimi, that countrified, you see. I had not then learned to 
read my own name; although I had been attending the school 
242 



for almost tiuee months, I daresay I knew no more than I 
did when I entered the schoolroom for the first time. But I 
had to know, you see. Perhaps a man builds for his future in 
more ways than one, builds not only toward the body which 
will be his tomorrow or next year, but toward actions and 
the subsequent irrevocable courses of resultant action which 
his weak senses and intellect cannot foresee but which ten or 
twenty or thirty years from now he will take, will have to 
take in order to survive the act. Perhaps it -was that instinct 
and not I who grasped one of his arms as he drew back (I did 
not actually doubt him. I think that even then, even at my 
age, I realized that he could not have invented it, that he 
lacked that something which is necessary in a man to enable 
him to fool even a diild by lying. But you see, I had to be 
sure, had to take whatever method that came to my hand to 
make sure. And there was nothing else to hand except him) 
glaring at me and beginning to struggle, and I holdhig him 
and saying — I was quite calm, quite calm; I just had to know 
— ^saying, “Suppose I went there and found out that it was 
not so?” and he shrieking now, diouting “Help! Help!” so 
that I let him go. So when the time came when I realitmd 
that to accomplish my design I should need first of all and 
above all thin^ money in considerable quantities and in the 
quite immediate future, 1 remembered what he had read to 
us and I went to the West Indies.’ 

“Then the other guests began to ride up, and after a while 
the niggers came back with the coffee pot and a deer haunch 
and the whiskey (and one botde of hamp^ne which they 
bad overlooked, Grand&amp;ther said) and Sutpen stopped talk- 
mg for a while. He didn’t tdl anymore of it until they had 
eaten and were sitting around smoking while the niggers and 
the dogs made cnsts in all direchons. They had to drag he 
dogs away firom he tree, but especially away fi:om he sap- 

243 



Bng pole widi the architect’s suspenders tied to it, as if it was 
not only that the pole was the last thing the ardhitect had 
touched but it was the thing his exultation had touched whai 
he saw another chance to dude them, and so it was not only 
the man but the exultation too which the dogs smelled that 
made them wild. The nigger and the dogs were getting fur- 
ther and firther away until just before sundown one of the 
niggere whooped and he (he hadn’t spoken for some time, 
Grandfethcr said, lying there on one elbow, in the fine boots 
and the only pants he had and the shirt he had put on when 
he came out of the mud and washed himself off after he re- 
alized that he would have to hunt the architect down him- 
self if he wanted him back alive probably, not talking him- 
self and maybe not even listening while the men talked about 
cotton and politics, just smoking the cigar Grandfether liad 
given him and looking at the fire embers and maybe making 
that West Indian voyage again that he had made when he 
was fourteen and didn’t even know where he was going or 
if he would ever get there or not, no more way of knowing 
whether the max who said the ship was going there were 
lyii^ or not than he had of knowing wdiether or not the 
school teacher was telling the trudi about what was in the 
book. And he never told whether the voyage was hard or 
not, how much he must have had to endure to make it. But 
then he believed that all that was neexssary was courage and 
shrewdness and the one he knew he had and tte other he be- 
lieved he could learn if it were to be taught, and it probably 
was the hardship of the voyage which comforted him and 
that the men who said the s^p was ^ing to the West Indies 
had not lied to him, became at that dm^ Grandfather said, 
be probably could not have believed in anything tl^ was

I ’? 



again, with, a gain of almost three hours. So they had to gc 
fast now and there wasn’t much time to talk, or at least. 
Grandfather said, he did not appear to intend to resume. 
Then the sun went down and the other men had to start hack 
to town; they all went except Grandfather, because he 
■wanted to listen some more. So he sent word in by one of 
the others (he was not married then either) that he would 
not be home, and he and Sutpen went on tintil the light 
felled. Two of the niggers (they were thirteen miles from 
Sutpen’s camp then) had already gone back to get blankets 
and more grub. Then it was dark and the niggers began to 
light pine knots and they went on for a litde while yet, gain- 
itig what they could now since they knew that the architect 
would have had to den soon after dark to keep from travel- 
ing in a circle. That was how Grandfather remembered it: 
he and Sutpen leading their horses (he would look back now 
and then and see the horses’ eyes shining in the torch li^ 
and the horses’ heads tossing and the shadows slipping along 
their shouldos and flanks) and the dogs and the niggers (the 
niggers mostly sdll naked except ft&gt;r a pair of pants here and 
there) with the pine torches smoking and flaring above them 
and the red l%ht on their round heads and arms and the mud 
they wore in the swamp to keep the mosquitoes off dried 
hard and shiny, glinting like glass or china and the shadows 
they cast taller than they were at one moment then gone the 
next and even the trees and brake and thickets there one 
Tnoment and gone the next though you knew all the time 
thaf they were still there because you could feel them with 
your breathing, as though, invisible, they presed down and 
condensed the invisible air you breathed. And he said how 
Sutpen was talking about it again, t ell i ng bim again before 
he realized that this was some more of it, and he said how he 
thot^ht there was something about a man’s destiny (or 

245 



about the man) that caused the destiny to shape itself to him 
like his dothes did, like the same coat that new might have 
fitted a thousand men, yet after one man has worn it for a 
whfle it fits no one else and you can tell it anywhere you see 

it even if all you see is a sleeve or a lapel; so that his 

(“the demon’s,” Shreve said) “ — destiny had fitted itself to 
him, to his innocence, his pristine aptitude for platform 
dra m a and childlike heroic simplidty, just as the fine broad- 
dofh uniform which you could have seen on ten thousand 
men during those four years, which he wore when he came 
in the office on that afternoon thirty years later, had fitted 
itself to the swaggering of all his gestures and to the forensic 
verbiage in which he stated calmly, with that frank inno- 
cence which we call ‘of a child’ except that a human child is 
the only living creature that is never either firank or innocent, 
the most simple and the most outrageous things. He was tdl- 
ing some more of it, was already into what he was telling 
yet still without telling how he got to where he was, nor 
even how what he was now involved in came to oamr (he 
was obviously at Irast twenty years old at the time he was 
telling about, crouching behind a window in the dark and 
firing the muskets through it whidi someone else loaded and 
handed to him), getting himself and Grandfother both into 
that besieged jEiaitian room as simply as he got himsdf to 
the West Indies by saying that he decided to go to the West 
Indies and so he went there. This anecdote was no deliberate 
continuation of the other one but was merdy called to his 
mind by the picture of the niggers and torches in firont of 
tiiem; he not telling how he got there, what had happened 
during the six years between that day when he had decided 
to go to the West hidtes and become ruh, and this night 
whoi, overseer or foreman or something to a French sugar 
planter, he was barricade in the bouse with foe planter’ s fom- 



ily. And now Grandfather said there was the first mention — 
a shadow that almost emerged for a moment and then faded 

again but not completely away — of the ” (“It’s a girl,” 

Shreve said. “Dont tell me. Just go on.”) “ ^woman whom 

he was to tell Grandfather thirty years afterward he had 
found unsuitable to his purpose and so put aside, though 
providing for her and there were a few frightened half-breed 
servants with them who he would have to turn from the 
window from time to time and kick and curse into helping 
fibe girl load the muskets which he and the planter fired 
through the windows. And I reckon Grandfather was saying 
‘Wait, wait for God’s sake wait’ about like you are, until he 
finally did stop and back up and start over again with at 
least some regard for cause and effea even if none for logical 
sequence and continuity. Or maybe it was the fact that they 
were sitting again now, having decided that they had gone 
Br enough for that night, and the n%gers had made camp 
and cooked supper and they (he and Grandfather) drank 
some of the whiskey and ate and then sat before the fire 
drinking some more of the whiskey and he idling it all over 
and still it was not absolutely dear — the how and the why 
he was there and what he was— since he was not t al king 
about hims elf. He was teHiog a story. He was not bragging 
about something he had donej he was just tdling a story 
about something a man named Thomas Sutpen had experi- 
enced, which would still have been the same story if the man 
had had no name at all, if it had been toU about any man 
or no man over whiskey at night. 

“That may have bear what slowed him down. But it was 
not enough to clarify the story mucL He still was not re- 
counting to Grandfather the career of somebody named 
Thomas Sutpescu Grandfather said the only mention he ever 
to those six or seven y«“ars which must have existed 

247 



somewhere, must have actually occurred was about lie pa- 
tois he hzd to learn in order to oversee the plantation, and 
die French he had to kara, maybe not to get engaged to be 
married, but which he 7,'ould certainly need to be able to 
repudiate die wife after he had already got her — ^how, so he 
told Grandfather, he hatl believed that courage and shrewd- 
ness would be enough but found that he was wrong and how 
sorry he was that he had not taken the schooling ^ng with 
the West Indian lore vrhen he discovered that all people did 
not speak the same tongue and realized that he would not 
only need courage and skill, he would have to Icam to speak 
a new language, eLe that design to which he had dedicated 
himself would die still-bom. So he learned the language just 
like he learned to be a sailor I reckon, because Grantfiather 
adeed him why he didn’t get himself a girl to live with and 
learn it the easy way and Grandfather said how he sat there 
with the fireh'gbt on his face and the beard and bis eyes quiet 
and sort of bright, and said — ^and Grandfather said it was the 
only ome he ever knew him to say anything quiet and sim- 
ple; ‘On this night I am speaking of (and until my first mar- 
riage, I might add) I was still a virgin. You will probably 
not believe that, and if I were to try to explain it you would 
disbelieve me more than ever. So I will oidy say that that too 
was a part of the des%n which I had in my mind’ and Grand- 
fether said, ‘Why shouldn’t I believe itt’ and he looking at 
Grandfather still with that quiet bright expression about the 
ey&lt;s, saying, ‘But do yous Surely you dont hold me in such 
small contempt as to believe that at twenty I could neithar

said, ‘You’re right I shouldn’t believe it But I da’ So it was

tliat-niglit (or the seven or eight nights wliile they huddkd 
in die dark and watched from the windows the bams or 
granaries or whatever it is you harvest sugar into, and the 
fields too, blazing and smolang: he said how you could 
smell it, you could smell nothing else, the rank sweet rich 
smell as if the hatred and the implacabihty, the thousand 
secret dark years which had created the hatred and implaca- 
bility, had intensified the smell of the sugar: and Grandfather 
said how he remembered then that he had seen Sutpen each 
time decline sugar for his coffee and so he (Grandfather) 
knew why now but he asked anyway to be sure and Sutpen 
told him it was true; that he had not been afraid until after 
the fields and bams were all burned and they had even forgot 
about the smell of the burning sugar, but that he had never 
been able to bear sugar since) — the girl just emerging for a 
second of the telling, in a single word almost, so that Grand- 
fether said it was like he had just seen her too for a second by 
the flash of one of the muskets — z bent face, a single chedk, 
a chin for an instant beyond a curtain of f^len hair, a white 
slaider arm raised, a ddheate hand clutching a ramrod, and 
that was alL No more detail and information about that than 
about how he got firom the field, his overseeing, into the be- 
sieged house when the niggers rushed at him with their 
machetes, than how he got from the rotting cabin in Vir- 
ginia to the fields he oversaw: and this, Grandfather said, was 
more incredible to him than the getting there from Virginia, 
because that did infer time, a space the getting across which 
did indicate something of leisurdiness since time is longer 
tbati any distance, while the other, the getting from the fidds 
into the barricaded house, seemed to have occurred with a 
sort of violent abrogation which must have been almost as 
short as his t elling about it— a very condensation of time 
winch was the gauge of its own violence, and he telling it in 

249 



tiiat pleasant faintly forensic anecdotal manner apparently 
just as he rememhered it, was impressed by u through de- 
tached and impersonal interest and curiosity which even fear 
(that once when he mentioned fear by that same inverse 
process of speaking of a time when he was not a&amp;aid, before 
he became afraid, he put it) failed to leaven very much. Be- 
cause he was not afraid until after it was all over, Grandfather 
said, because that was all it was to him — z spectacle, some- 
thing to be watched because he might not have a chance to 
see it again, since his innocence still functioned and he not 
only did not know what fear was until afterward, he did not 
even know that at first he was not tejrnficd; did not even 
know that he had found the place where money was to be 
had quick if you w'ere courageous and shrewd (he did not 
mean shrewdness, Grandfether said. What he meant was un- 
scrupulousness only he didn’t know that word because it 
would not have been in the book from which the school 
teacher read. Or maybe that was what he meant by courage. 
Grandfather said) but where high mortality was concomi- 
tant with the money and the shon on the dollars was not 
from gold but from blood — z spot of earth which might 
have been created and set aside by Heaven itself Grandfather 
said, as a theater for violence and injustice and bloodshed and 
all the Satanic lusK of human greed and cruelty, for the last 
despairing fury of all the pariah-interdict and all the doomed 
— z little island set in a smiling and fury-lurked and incredible 
indigo sea, which was the halfway point between what we 
call the jungle and what we call civilization, halfway be- 
tween the dark inscrutable continent from wMch the black 
blood, the black bones and fiesh and thinking and remember- 
and hopes and desires, was rawshed by violaice, and the 
cold laaown land to which it was doomed, the civilized land 
and people which had expelled some of its own blood and 
aso 



thinking and desires diat had become too crass to be faced 
and borne longer, and set it homeless and desperate on the 
lonely ocean — a little lest island in a latitude which would 
require ten thousand years of equatorial heritage to bear its 
climate, a soil manured with black blood from two hundred 
years of oppression and exploitation until it sprang with an 
incredible paradox of peaceful greenery and crimson flowers 
and sugar cane sapling size and three times the height of a 
man and a litde bulkier of course but valuable pound for 
pound almost with silver ore, as if nature held a balance and 
kept a book and ofiered a recompense for the tom limbs and 
outraged hearts even if man did not, the planting of nature 
and man too watered not only by the wasted blood but 
breathed over by the winds in which the doomed ships had 
fled in vain, out of which the last tatter of sail had sunk into 
the blue sea, along which the last vain despairing cry of 
woman or child had blown away — ^the planting of men too; 
the yet intact bones and brains in which the old unsleeping 
blood that had vanished into the 'earth they trod still cried 
out for vengeance. And he overseeing it, riding peacefully 
about on his horse while he learned the language (dut 
meager and fragile thread. Grandfather said, by which the 
little surface comers and edges of men’s secret and sohtary 
lives may be joined for an instant now and then before siok- 
ing back into the darkness where the spirit cried for the first 
time and was not heard and will cry for the last time and wdli 
not be heard thm dther), not knowing that what he rode 
upon was a volcano, hearing the air tremble and throb at 
flight with the drums and the chanting and not knowdng 
that it was the heart of the earth itself he heard, who believed 
(Grandfather said) that earth was kind and gentle and that 
darlmwts was merely something you saw, or could not see in; 
oveiseeing what he oversaw and not knowing that he was 

251 



owKceing it, rnaking his daily expeditions from an armed 
citadel until the day itself came. And he not telling that 
either, how that day happened, the stq&gt;s leading up to it be- 
cause Grandfatlier said he apparendy did not know, aom- 
prehend, what he must have been seeing every day because 
of that innocence — z pig’s bone with a little rotten flesh still 
dinging to it, a few chicken feathers, a stained dirty rag with 
a few pebbles tied up in it found on the old man’s pillow one 
morning and none knew (least of afl, the planter himself 
who had been asleep on the pillow) how it had come there 
because mey learned at the same time that all the servants, the 
half breeds, were missing, and he did not know until the 
planter told him that the stains on the rag were neither dirt 
nor grease but blood, nor that what he took to be the plant- 
er’s gallic rage was actually fear, terror, and he just curious 
and quite interested because he stiU looked upon the planter 
and die daughter both as foreigners. He told Grandfather 
how until that first night of the siege he had not once thought 
that he did not know the girl’s Christian name, whether he 
had ever heard it or not. He also told Grandfather, dropped 
this into the telling as you might flidt the joker out of a padc 
of fresh cards without being able to remember later whether 
you had removed the joker or not, that the old man’s wife 
had been a Spaniard, and so it was Grandfather and not Sut- 
pen who realized that until that first night of the attack he 
had possibly not seen the girl as much as a dozen times. The 
body of one of the half breeds was found at last; Sutpen 
fomd it, hunted for it for two days without even knowing 
diat what he was meeting was a blank wall of black secret 
feces, a wall behind which almost anything cotfld be prepar- 
ing to happen and, as he learned latar, almost anything was, 
and m the third day he found the body where he could not 
possihly have miss^ it during the first hour of the first day 
zsz 



if it had been, there. AH the time he was speaking he was sit- 
ting on the log, Grandfadier said, telling it, making the ges- 
tures to tell it with, the man Grandfather himse lf had seen 
fight naked chest to chest with one of his wild ruggers by the 
light of the camp fire while his house was building and who 
sdl fought with them by lantern %ht in the stable after he 
had got at last that wife who would be adjunctive to the for- 
warding of that design he had in mind, and no bones made 
about the fighting either, no handshalcing and gratulations 
while he washed the blood off and donned his shirt because 
at the end of it the nigger would be flat on his back with his 
chest heaving and another nigger throwing water on him. 
He was sitting there on the log telling Grandfather how at 
last he fbimd the half breed, or what used to be the half 
breed, and so began to comprdhend that the situation might 
become serious; then the house, the barricade, the five of 
them — the planter, the daughter, two women servants and 
himself— shut up in it and Sie air filled with the smnlrft and 
smell of burning cane and the glare and smoke of it on the 
sky and the air throbbing and trembling with the drums and 
the chanting — ^the little lost island beneath its down-cupped 
bowl of alternating day and night like a vacuum into w6&lt;h 
no help could come, where not even winds fi:om the outer 
world tame but only the trades, Ae same weary winds blow- 
ing back and forth across it and burdened still with the weary 
voicesofmurderaiwomenandchiidrenhomclessandgraveless 
about the isolating and solitary sea— while Ae two servants 
and the girl whose Christian name he did not yet know 
loaded the muskets which, he and the father fired at no 
enemy but at Ae Haitiean night itself, lancing Aeir litde vain 
and puny flashes into Ae brooding and bloodrweary and 
throbbing darkness: and it Ae very time of year, Ae season 
between hurricanes and any hope of rain. And he told how 

253 



cm liie eightii night tie water gave out and something had 
to be done so he put tie musket down and went out and sub- 
dued them. That was how he told it: he went out and subdued 
them, and when he returned he and the girl became engaged 
to marry and Grandfather saying ‘Wait wait’ sure enough 
now, saying, ‘But you didn’t even know her; you told me 
dm when the siege began you didn’t even know her name’ 
and he looked at Grandfather and said, ‘Yes. But you see, 
it took me some time to recover.’ Not how he did it He 
didn’t teE that either, that of no moment to the story 
either; he just put the musket down and had someone unbar 
the &lt;hsor and then bar it behind him, and walked out into 
the daricncss and subdued them, maybe by yelling louder, 
maybe by standing, bearing more than they believed any 
bones and flesh could or should (should, yes: that would be 
the temble thing: to find flesh to stand more than flesh 
should be asked to stand); maybe at last they themselves 
turning in horror and fleeing firom the white arms and legs 
shaped like theirs and from which blood could be made to 
^urt and flow as it could firom thein and containing an in- 
domitable spirit which should have come from the same 
primary fire which theirs came from but which could not 
have, could not possibly have. He showed Grandfather the 
scars, one of which. Grandfather said, came pretty near leav- 
ing him that virgin for the rest of his life too. And then day- 
light came with no drums in it for the first time in eight 
days, and they emerged probably the man and the daughter) 
and walked across the burned land with the br%ht sun shin- 
ing down on it as if nothing had happened, 'walking now in 
what must have been an inaedible desolate solitude and 
peaceful quiet, and found him and broi^t him to the house: 
and when he recovered he and the girl were engagoi Then 
stopped.” 

m 



“AE right,” Shreve said “Go on.” 

“I said he stopped,” Quentin said. 

I heard you. Stopped what? How got engaged and then 
stopped, yet still had a wife to repudiate later? You said he 
didn’t remember how he got to Haiti, and then he didn’t re- 
member how he got into the house with the niggers sur- 
rounding it. Now are you going to tell me he didn’t even 
remember getting married? That he got engaged and dben 
he decided he would stop, only one day he found out he 
h ad n’ t stopped but on the contrary he was married? And all 
you called him was just a virgia?” 

“He stopped talhing, telling it,” Quentin said. He had not 
moved, talldng apparendy (if to anything) to the letter lying 
on the open book on the table between Ids hands. Opposite 
h i m Shreve had filled the pipe and smoked it out ggatn it 
lay again overturned, a scattering of white ashes fanning out 
firom the bowl, onto the uble bdfore his crossed naked arms 
with which he appeared at the same time both to support 
and hug himself, since although it was only eleven odock 
the room was beginning to cool toward that point what; 
about midnight there would be only enough heat in die radi- 
ators to keep the pipes from freezing, though (he would not 
perform his deep-breathing in the open window tonight at 
all) he had yet to go to the bedroom and return first with 
his bathrobe on and neict with his overcoat on top of the 
bathrobe and Quentin’s overcoat on his arm. “He just said 
that he was now engaged to be married” Quentin said, “and 
then he stopped telling it. He just stopped. Grandfather said, 
flat and final like that, like that was dl there was, all there 
could be to it, all of it that made good listening from one 
man to another over whiskey at ni^bt. Maybe it was.” He 
(Quentin’s) face vras lowered. He spoke still m that curious, 
that almost sullen flat tone which had caused Shreve to 

ass 



watch him from the beginning with intent cktached specu- 
lation and curiosity, to watch him still from behind his 
(Shreve’s) expression of cherubic and erudite amazement 
which the spectacles intensified or perhaps actually created- 
“Sutpen just got up and looked at the whiskey botde and 
said, ‘No more tonight We’ll get to sleep; W'e "want to get 
an early start tomorrow. Maybe ■we can catch him before 
he limbers up.’ 

“But they didn’t It was late afternoon before they caught 
him — ^the architect I mean — and then only because he had 
hurt Iiis kg trying to architect himself across the river. But 
he made a mistake in the calculation this time so the dogs and 
the niggers bayed him and the niggen making the racket 
now as they hauled him out Grandfather said how maybe 
the niggers believed that by fleeing the architect had volun- 
tarily surrendered his status as interdict meat, had voluntarily 
tiered the gambit by fleeing, which the niggers had ac- 
cepted by chasing him and won by catching him, and that 
now they would be allowed to cook and cat him, both vic- 
tors and vanquished accepting this in the same spirit of sport 
and sportsmanship and no rancor or hard feelings on either 
side. All the men who had started the race yesterday had 
come bade except three, and the ones that returned had 
brought others, so there were more of them now than when 
the race started. Grandfather said. So they hauled him out of 
his cave under the river bank: a little man ■with one sleeve 
mi ss ing from his froth coat and his flowered vest ruined by 
water and mud where be had fallen in the river and one 
pants leg ripped down so they could sec where he had tied 
up his leg with a piec« of his shirt tail and the rag bbody and 
&amp; kg swollen, and his hat ■was completely gone. Ihey 
sever did find it so Grandfather gave him a new hat the day 
he kfr whoa the house was finished. It was in Grand&amp;ther’s 
256 



office and Grandfather said the architca took the new hat 
and looked at it and burst into tears. — ^a little harried wild- 
feced man with a two-days’ stubble of beard, who came out 
of the cave fighting like a wildcat, hurt leg and all, with the 
dogs barking and the niggers ivhoo|iing and hollering with 
deadly and merry antidparion, like they were under t£e im- 
pression that since the race had lasted more than twentj'-four 
hours the rules would be automatically abrogated and they 
would not have to wait to cook him until Sutpen waded in 
with a short stick and beat niggers and dogs ^ away, leav- 
ing the architect standing there, not scared worth a damn 
either, just panting a little and Grandfather said a little sick 
in the face where the niggers had mishandled his leg in the 
heat of the capture, and making them a speech in French, a 
long one and so fast that Grandfather said probably another 
Renchman could not have understood all of it But it 
sounded fine; Grandfather said even he— all of them?— could 
tell that the architert was not apologizing; it was fine, Grand- 
fether said, and he said how Sutpen turned toward him but 
he (Grandfather) was already approaching the architect, 
holdmg out the bottle of whiskey already uncorked. And 
Grandfather saw the eyes in the gaunt face, the eyes desperate 
and hopeless but indomitable too, invincible too, not beaten 
yet by a damn right Grandfather said, and all that fifty-odd 
hours of dark and swamp and rieeplessness and fatigue and 
no grub and nowhere to go and no hope of getting there: 
just a will to endure and a foreknowing of defeat but not 
beat yet by a damn sight: and he took the bottle in one of 
his H^e dirty coon-like hands and raised the other hand and 
even fumbled about his head for a second before he reman- 
bered that the hat was gone, then flung the hand up in a ges- 
ture that Grandfather said you simply could not describe, 
that seemed to gather aU misfortune and defeat that the 



htiman race ever suffered into a litde pinch in his fingers hke 
dust and fling it backward over his head, and raised the 
bottle and bowed first to Grandfather thai to all Ak other 
men sitting their horses in a circle and looking at him, and 
then he took not only the first drink of neat whiskey he ever 
took in his life but the drink of it diat he could no more have 
conceived himself taking than the Brahmin can believe that 
that situation can conceivably arise in which he will eat dog.” 

Quentin ceased. Atonce Shrevesaid, “Allright-Dont bother 
to say he stop^d talking now; just go on,” But Quentin 
did not continue at once— the flat, curiously dead voice, 
the downcast face, the relaxed body not stirring except to 
breathe; the two of them not moving except to breathe, both 
young, both bom within the same year: the one in Alberta, 
dhe other in Mississippi; bom half a continent apart yet 
joined, connected after a feshion in a sort of geographical 
transubstantiation by that Continental Trough, that River 
vhich runs not only thror^ the physical land of which it 
is the geologic umbilical, not only runs through the spiritual 
lives of the l^ngs within its scope, but is very Environment 
itself which. laughs at degrees of latitude and temperature, 
thot^ some of them beings, like Shreve, have nev^ seen 
it— the two of them who four monhs ago had never lail 
eyes on cme another yet who since had dept in the same room 
and eaten side by side of the same ft&gt;od and used the same 
books from which to prepare to recite in the same fijehman 
course, fttcing one another across the kmplit table on which 
lay the fingfle pandora’s box of scrawled paper which had 
filled with violent and uniatiodnative djinns and demons 
the SQug monastic coign, this dreamy and headess alcove of 
what we call the best of thooght bother,” Shreve 

said. “Just get on widi it.” 

‘That would take thirty years," Quentin saicL *Tt was 

2$8 



thirty yeaxs before Suqjea told Grandfather any more of it. 
Maybe he was too busy. All his time for spare talking taken 
up widh furthering that design which he had in mind,'and 
his only relaxation fighting his wild niggers in the stabk 
where the men could hitch their horses and come up firom 
the back and not be seen from the house because he was al- 
ready married now, his house finished and he already ar- 
rested for stealing it and freed again so that was all settled, 
with a wife and two children— no, three— in k and his land 
dearal and planted with the seed Grandfather loaned him 
and httn getting rich good and steady now ” 

“Yes,” Shreve said; “Mr Coldfield: what was that?” 

“I dont know,” Quentin said. “Nobody ever did know 
for certain. It was something about a bill of lading, some 
way he persuaded Mr Coldfield to use his credit: one of 
those rhings that when they work you were smart and when 
they dont you change your name and move to Tetcas: and 
Father said how Mr Coldfield must have sat back there in 
his little store and watched his wagonload of stock double 
maybe every ten yeans or at least not lose any ground and 
seen the chance to do that very same thing all the time, only 
his conscience (not his courage: Father said he had plenty of 
that) wouldn’t let him. Then Sutpen came along and ofiered 
to do it, he and Mr Coldfield to ^vide the loot if it worked, 
and he (Sutpen) to talm all the blame if it didn’t. And Mr 
Col dfi ftld let him. E^er said it was because Mr Coldfield 
did not helfeve it would work, that they would get amy 
with it, only he couldn’t quit thinking about it, and so when 
they tried it and it failed he (Mr Coldfield) would be able 
to get it out of his mind then; and that when it did feU and 
they woe caught, Mr Coldfidd wotM insist on taking his 
diare &lt;£ the blame as poiance and espiation for havic^ 
tinned in his mind all SitKe years. Because Mr Coldfiield 

259 



never did believe it would work, so when he saw that it was 
going to work, had worked, the least thing he could do was 
to refuse to take his share of the profits; that when he saw 
that it had worked it was his conscience he hated, not Sutpai 
— ^his conscience and the land, the country which had created 
his conscience and then offered the opportunity to have 
made all that money to the conscienoe which it had created, 
which could do nothing but decline; hated that country so 
much that he was even glad when he saw it drifting closer 
and closer to a doomed and fatal war; that he would have 
joined the Yankee army. Father said, only he was not a sol- 
dier and knew that he would either be killed or die of hard- 
ship, and so he would not be present on that day when the 
South would realize that it was now paying the price for 
having erected its economic edifice not on the rock of stem 
morality but on the shifting sands of opportunism and moral 
brigand^. So he chose the only gesture he could think of 
to impress his disapproval on these who should oudive the 
fighting and so participate in the remorse ” 

“Sore,” Shreve said. “That’s fine. But Sutpien. The de- 
rign- Get &lt;m, now.” 

“Yes,” Quentin said. “The design.— Gdfing richer and 
richer. It most have looked fine and dear ahead for him now: 
house finished, and even biggar and whiter than the one he 
had gone to the door of that day and the nigger came in his 
monkey dothes and told him to go to the baii, and he with 
his own brand of niggers evai, which the man who lay in 
tlK hammock with his shoes off didn’t have, to cull one 
ficom and train him to go to the door when his turn cams 
&amp;r a little boy without any shoes on and with hs pap’s cut- 
down pants for dothes to (X&gt;me and knodk on it Only 
Father said that that wasn’t it now, that wbrai he to 
Giaiui^her’s office that day afiec the thirty yeses, and not 
snSo’ 



trying to excuse now anymore than he had tried in the bot- 
tom that night when they ran the architect, but just to ex- 
plain now, trying hard to explain now because now he was 
old and knew it, knew it was being old that he had to talk 
against: time shortening ahead of him that could and would 
do things to his chances and possibihties even if he had no 
more doubt of his bones and flesh than he did of his will and 
courage, telling Grandfadher that the boy-symbol at the 
door wasn’t it because the boy-symbol was just the figment 
of the amazed and desperate child; that now he would take 
that boy in where he would never again need to stand on 
the outside of a white door and knock at it: and not at all for 
mete shelter but so that that boy, that whatever nameless 
stranger, could shut that door himself forever behind him 
on all that he had ever known, and look ahead along the 
still undivu^ed %ht rays in which his descendants who 
tnight not even ever hear his (the boy’s) name, waited to be 
bom without even having to know liat they had once been 
.riven forever free from brutehood just as his own (Sutpen’s) 
children were " 

“Dont say it’s just me that sounds like your old man,” 
Shreve said, “But go on. Sutpen’s diildren. Go on.” 

“Yes,” Quentin said. “The two children” th i nk i ng Yes. 
Maybe we are both Ftoher. Maybe nothing ever happens once and 
is finished. Maybe happen is never once but like ripples maybe on 
water after the pebble sinks, the ripples moving on, spreading, the 
pool attached by a narrow umbilical water-cord to the next pool 
which tlw first pool feeds, has fed, did feed, let this second pool 
contain a different temperature of ivater, a different molemlarity of 
having seen, felt, remembered, r fieri in a different tone the infinite 
itfuhanging sky, it doesn’t matter: that pebble’s watery echo whose 
fall it did not even see moves across its surface too at the original 
ri^k~sparx, to the oU meradkable rhythm thinking Yes, we are 

2di 



hath Father. Or mayhe Father and I are both Skreve, maybe it 
took FiUker and me both to make Shreve or Shreae and me both 
to make Father or maybe Thomas Sutpen to tnake all of us. 

“Yes, die two children, the son and the daughter by sex 
and age so ghb to the design that he might have planned that 
too, by character mental and physical so glib to it that he 
might have culled them out of the celestial herd of seraphs 
and dierubim like he chose his twenty niggers out of v/hat- 
ever swapping there must have been when he repudiated 
diat first ■'^e and that child when he discovered ihat they 
would not be ac^uncrive to the forwarding of the design. 
And Grandfather said there was no conscience about that, 
that Sutpen sat in die office that afternoon after thirty years 
and told him how his consdoice had bothered him some- 
what at first but that he had argued calmly and logically 
with his consdaice until it was setded, just ss he must have 
argued with his conscience about his and Mr Coldfield’s bill 
of ladii^ (only probably not as long here, since time hem 
would presing) until that was settled— how he granted 
that by certain %hts there was injustice in what he did but 
that he had obviated that as much as lay in his power by be- 
ing aboveboard in the matter; that he could have simply 
(feertal her, could have taken his hat and walked out, but 
he did not: and that he had what Grand&amp;ther would have 
to admit was a good and valid daim, if not to the whole 
place which he alone had saved, as wdl as the lives of all the 
white people on it, at least to that portion of it which had 
famt specifically described and deeded to him in the mar- 
ria^ settkmmt which he had entered in good faith, with 
no r«ervations as to his obscure origin and material equip- 
meiu:, while theae had been not only reservation but actud 
misRpresentation on their part and misrepresentation of 
stxh a crass nature as have not only voided and fimstrated 

atSa * 



without his knowing it the central motivation of his entire 
design, but to have made an ironic delusion of all that he 
had suffered and endured in the past and all tliat he could 
ever accomplish in the future toward that design — ^which 
riaim he had voluntarily relinquished, taking only the 
twenty niggers out of all he might have claimed and which 
many another man in his place would have insisted upon 
keeping and (in which contention) would have been sup- 
ported by both legal and moral sanction even if not the deli- 
cate one of conscience; and Grandfather not saying ‘Wait 
wait’ now because it was that innocence again, that inno- 
cence which believed that the ingredients of morality were 
like the ingredients of pie or cake and once you had measured 
and balanced them and mixed them and put them into 
the overt it was all finished and nothing but pic or cake could 
come out. — ^Yes, skting there in Grandfather’s office trying 
to ^-Yplain with that patient amazed recapitulation, not to 
Gra ndfather and not to himsdf because Grandfather said 
that his very calmness was indication that he had long since 
given up aUy hope of ever understanding it, but trying to 
e xp lain to circnmstance, to fate itself, the logical steps by 
which he had arrived at a result absolutely and forever in- 
credible, repeating the clear and simple synopsis of Hs history 
(which he and Grandfether both now knew) as if he were 
trying to p^f plam it to an intractible and unpredictable child: 

“ ‘You see, I had adcs%ninmy mind. Whether it was a 
good or a bad design is beside the point; the question is. 
Where did I make the mistake in it, what did I do or misdo 
itt it, whom or what injure by it to the extent which this 
wotdd indicate. I had a design. To accomplish it I should 
require money, a house, a plantation, slaves, a fitmfly— in- 
cidentally of cour^, a wife. I set out to acquire these, asking 
no favor of any man. I even risked my life at one time, as 1 

263 



toM you, tliougli as I also toM you I did not undertake this 
risk purely and simply to gain a wife, though it did have 
that result But that is beside the point also: suffice that I had 
the wife, accepted her in good faith, with no reservations 
about myself, and I expected as much firom them. I did not 
even demand, mind, as one of my obscure origin might have 
bem opected to do (or at least be condoned in the doit^) 
out of ignorance of gentility in dealing with gendebom 
people. I did not demand; I accepted them at their own val- 
uation while insBti^ on my own part upon explaining 
Billy about myself and my progenitors: yet they deliberately 
withheld from me the one feet which I have reason to know 
they were aware would have caused me to decline the entire 
matter, otherwise they would not have withheld it from me 
— a fert whkh I did not learn until after my son was bom. 
And even then I did not act hastily. I could have reminded 
them of these wasted years, these years which would now 
leave me bdimd with my schedule not only the amount of 
elapsal time which their number represented but that com- 
pensatory amount of time represented by their number 
which I diould now have to ipend to advance mysdf oocs 
more to the point I had readbed and lost. But I did not I 
marely explafeed how this new fact rendered it impossible 
that this woman and child he incorpoxatedin my design, and 
fdlowiEg which, as I told you, I made no attempt to keep 
not only diat which I might consider mysdf to have earned 
at the risk of my life hut which had been given to me by 
signed testimoniais, but on the contrary I ^dined and re- 
signed all right and claim to this In order that I might repair 
whatever injustice I might he considered to have done by so 
providing for the two prasons whom I m%;ht he considared 
to have dprived of anything I mi^ht later pcBse®: and this 
was agreed to, mind; ageem to between the two partfes.

And yet, and after more than thirty years, more than thirty 
years after my comdence had finally assured me that if I had 

done an injustice, I had done -what I could to rectify it * 

and Grandfether not saying ‘Wait’ now but saying, hollering 
maybe even: ‘Conscience? Conscience? Good God, tnan, 
what else did you expect? Didn’t the very affinity and in- 
stinct for misfortune of a man who had spent tihat nn ^^' h 
time in a monastery even, let alone one who had lived rlia» 
mmj years as you lived them, tell you better than that? 
didn’t the dread and fear of females which you must have 
drawn in with the primary mammalian milk teach you bet- 
ter? What kind of ab3?smal and purblind innocence could 
that have been which someone told you to call virginity? 
what conscience to trade with which would have warranted 

you in the belief that you could have bought iimnuiuty from 

her for no other coin but justice?* ” 

It was at this point that Shreve went to the bedroom and 
put on the bathrobe. He did not say Wait, he Just rose and 
left Quentin sitting before the table, the open fc)ok and the 
letter, and went out and returned in the robe and sat again 
and took up the cold pipe, though without filling it anew or 
lighting it as it was. “All right,” he said. “So that Christmas 
Henry brought him home, into the house, and the denon 
looked up and saw the face he believed he had paid off and 
discharged twenty-eight years ago. Go on.” 

“Yes,” Quentin said. “Father said he probably named 
him himself. Charles Bon. Charles Gooi He didn’t tell 
Grandfather that he did, but Grandfather bdieved he did, 
would have. That would have been a part of the deaning 
np, just as he would have done Ins share toward cleaning up 
the explocfed caps and musket cartridges after the siege if 
he hadn’t been sick (or maybe engaged); he would have inr- 
sisted on it maybe, dbe conscience again whidhi could not 

265 



allow her and the child any place in the desi^ even though 
he could have dosed his eyes and, if not fooled the rest of 
the world as they had fooled him, at least have frightened 
any man out of speaking the secret aloud — the same con- 
sdence which would not permit the child, since it was a boy, 
to hear either his name or that of its maternal grandfather, 
yet which would also forbid him to do the customary and 
provide a quick husband for the discarcfcd woman and so 
^e his son an authentic name. He chose the name himself, 
Grandfether believed, just as he named diem all — the Charles 
Goods and the Clytemnestras and Henry and Judith and all 
of them — ^that entire fecundity of dragons’ teeth as fiither 
called it. And Fadier said ” 

“Your fother,” Shreve said. “He seems to have got an 
awful lot of delayed information awfiil quick, after having 
waited forty-five years. If he knew all this, what was his rea- 
son for t ellin g you that the trouble betweai Henry and Bon 
was the octoroon woman?” 

“He didn’t know it thm. Grandfather didn’t tell him all 
of it either, like Stttpcn never told Grandftither quite all of 
It 

“Than who did tell him?” 

“I did.” Quentin did not move, did not look up while 
Shreve watcW him. “The day after we — after that n%ht 
when we ” 

“Oh,” Shreve said. “After you and the old aunt I see. Go 
on. And fother said -” 

“ said how he must have stood there on the front gal- 

lery that afternoon and waited for Henry and the frioid 
Hmry had been writing home about all ftll to come up the 
drive, and that maybe after Henry wrote the ttame in the 
first letter Sutpen probably told hhnsdf it couldn’t be, that 
dffitc was a Ihnit even to irony beyond which it became 
add 



either just vicious but not fatal horseplay or harmless co- 
incidence, since father said that even Sutpen probably knew 
that nobody yet ever invented a name that somebody didn’t 
own now or hadn’t owned once: and they rode up at last 

and Henry sai4 ‘Father, this is Charles’ and he (“the 

demon,” Shreve said) “ saw the face and knew that there 

are situations where coincidence is no more than the little 
child that rushes out onto a football field to take part in the 
game and the players run over and around the unscathed 
head and go on and shock together, and in the fury of the 
struggle for the facts called gain or loss nobody even remem- 
bers the child nor saw who came and snatched it back from 
dissolution — that he stood there at his own door, just as he 
had imagined, plaimed, designed, and sure enough and after 
fifty years the forlorn nameless and homeless lost child came 
to knock at it and no monkey-dressed nigger anywhere 
under the sun to come to the door and order the child away; 
and Father said that even then, even though he knew that 
Bon and Judith had never laid eyes on one another, he must 
have felt and heard the design — Chouse, position, posterity 
and all — come down like it had been b^t out of smoke, 
making no sound, creating no rush of displaced air and not 
even leaving any debris. And he not calling it retribution, 
no sins of the father come home to roost; not even calling 
it bad luck, but just a mistake: that mistake which he could 
not discover himself and which he came to Grandfather, not 
to excuse but just to review the facts for an impartial (and 
Grandfether said he believed, a legally trained) mind to ex- 
fttnine and find and point out to him. Not moral retribution 
you see: just an old mistake in feet which a man of courage 
and shrewdness (the one of which he now knew he pos- 
sessed, the other of which he believed that he had now 
learned, acquired) could still combat if he could only find 

'267 



oat what the mistake had been. Because he did not give up. 
He never did give up; Grandfather said that his subsequent 
actions (the fact that for a time he did nothing and so per- 
haps helped to bring about the very situation which he 
dreaded) were not the result of any failmg of courage or 
shrewdness or rudilessness, but were the r«ult of his convic- 
tion that it had all come from a misuke and until he dis- 
covered what that mistake had been he did not intend to 
risk making another one. 

“So he invited Bon into the house, and for the two weeks 
of the vacation (only it didn’t take that long; Father said 
that probably Mrs Sutpen had Judith and Bon already en- 
gaged from the moment she saw Son’s name in Henry’s 
first letter) he watched Bon and Henry and Judith, or 
watched Bon and Judith rather because he would have al- 
ready known about Henry and Bon from Henry’s letters 
about him from the school; watched them for two weeks, 
and did nothing. Then Henry and Bon went back to school 
and now die nigger groom that fetched the mail back and 
forth each week between Oxford and Sutpen’s Himdred 
brought letters to Judidi now that were not in Henry’s hand 
(and that not necessary either. Father said, because Mrs Sut- 
pen was already covering (he town and county both with 
news of that engagement that Father srid didn’t exist yet) 
and still he did nothing. He didn’t do anything at all until 
spring was almost over and Henry wrote diat he was bring- 
ing Bon home with him to stay a day or two before Bon 
went home. Then Sutpen went to New Ori^ns. Whether 
he chose diat time to go in order to get Bon and his mother 
togedier and thrash the business out for good and all or not, 
nobody knows, just as nobody knovre whether he ever saw 
the mother or not while he was there, if she received him 
or refused to receive him; or if she did and he tried once 



more to come to terms with her, buy ha: off maybe with 
money now, since Father said that a man who couH beKevc 
that a scorned and outraged and angry woman could be 
bought off tvith formal logic would believe that she could 
be placated with money too, and it didn’t work; or if Bon 
was there and it was Bon himself who refused the offe r, 
though nobody ever did know if Bon ever knew Sutpen 
was his father or not, whether he was trying to revenge his 
mother or not at first and only later fell in love, only later 
succumbed to the cunent of retribution and fiitality which 
Miss Rosa said Sutpen had started and had doomed all his 
blood to, black and white both. But it didn’t work evidently, 
and the next Christmas came and Henry and Bon came to 
Sutpen’s Hundred again and now Sutpen saw that there was 
no help for it, that Judith was in love with Bon and whether 
Bon wanted revenge or was just caught and sunk and doomed 
too, it was all the same. So it seems that he sent for Henry 
that Christmas eve just before supper timfi (Father said that 
maybe by now, after his New Orleans trip, he had learned 
at last aiough about women to know it wouldn’t do any 
good to go to Judith first) and told Henry. And he knew 
what Henry would say and Henry said it and he took the lie 
fi;om his son and Henry knew by his &amp;her t-alnng the lie 
that what his father had told him was true; and Father said 
that he (Sutpen) probably knew what Henry would do too 
and counted on Henry doing it because he still believed that 
it had been only a minor tactical mistake. So he was like a 
skirmisher who is omnumbered yet cannot retreat vriio be* 
lieves that if he is just patient enough and dever enough and 
calm enough and alert enou^ he can get the enemy scat- 
tered and pick them off one by one. And Henry did it. And 
he (Sutpen) probably knew what Henry would do next too, 
*hat Henry too wodd go to New Orleans to find out for 

269 



himsdf. Then it was ’ 6 l and Sutpen knew what they would 
do now, not only what Henry would do but what he would 
fora Bon to do; maybe (being a demon— though it would 
not require a demon to foresee W'ar now) he even foresaw 
dbat Henry and Bon would join that student company at the 
University; he may have had some way of watching, know- 
ing the day their names appeared on the roster, some way of 
knowing where the company was even before Grandfather 
became colonel of the regiment the company was in until 
he got hurt at Pittsburgh Landing (where Bon was wounded) 
and came home to get used to not having any right arm and 
Suqten came home in ’64 with the two tombstones and 
talked to Grandfather in the office that day before both of 
them went back to the war. Maybe he knew all the time 
where Henry and Bon were, that they had been all the time 
in Grandfather’s regiment where Grandfather could look 
after them in a fadiion even if Grandfitthcr didn’t know that 
he was doing it — even if tl^y needed watching, because Sut- 
pen must have known about the probation too, what Henry 
was doirg now: holding all three of them— himsdf and Ju- 
dith and Bon— in diat sospenaon while he wrestled with his 
cnosdence to make it come to terms with what he wanted 
to do just like his ffither had diat time more chan thirty years 
ago, maybe even turned fatalist like Bon now and giving the 
war a d^ce to settle the whole business by killing him or 
Bon Of both of them ^ut with no hdp, no fudging, on his 
part because it was him that carried Bon to the rear after 
Phtshurg^ landing) or maybe he knew that the Soudbt would 
be whipped and then there wouldn’t he anything left that 
mattered that much, w&lt;»th getting diat heated over, worffi 
protestiig against or suffering for or dying for or even liviig 
fin. That was the day came to tie c&amp;e, hb — ” (“the 

demou’s,” Shreve — one day of lacve at home, 

270 



came home with his tombstones. Ju&lt;3ith was there and I 
reckon he looked at her and she looked at him and he said, 
‘You know where he is’ and Judith didn’t lie to him, and (he 
knew Henry) he said, ‘But you have not heard from him 
yet’ and Judith didn’t lie about that either and she didn’t cry 
either because both of them knew what would be in the 
letter when it came so he didn’t have to ask, ‘When he writes 
you that he is coming, you and CKtie will start making the 
wedding dress’ even if Judith would have lied to him about 
that, which she would not have: so he put one of the stones 
on Ellen’s grave and set the other one up m the hall and 
came in to see Grandfather, trying to explain it, seeing if 
Grandfather could discover that mistake which he beheved 
was the sole cause of his problem, sitting there in his worn 
and shabby uniform, with his worn gaundets and faded sash 
and 0ie would have had the plume by all means. He might 
have had to discard his saber, but he would have had the 
plume) the plume in his hat broken and frayed and soiled, 
with his horse saddled and waiting in the street below and a 
thousand miles to ride to find his he sitting 

there on the one afternoon of his l^ve as though he had a 
thousand of them, as if there were no haste nor urgency any- 
where under the sun and that when he departed he had no 
further to go than the twelve miles out to Sutpen’s Hundred 
and a thousand days or maybe even years of monotony and 
rich peace, and he, even after he would become dead, still 
there, still watching the fine grandsons and great-grandsons 
springing as fer as eye couM reach; he still, even though dead 
in the earth, that same fine figure of a man that Wadi Jones 
called him, but not now. Now fog-bound by his own private 
embatdement of personal morality: diat picayune splitting 
of abstract hairs while (Grandfother said) Rome vanished 
and Jeridio crumbled, that Ais would be right if or that would 

271 



be tvTon£ but of slowing blood and stiffening bones and ar- 
teries that Father says men resort to in senility who while 
young and supple and strong reaaed to a single simple Yes 
and a single simple No as instantaneous and complete and un- 
thinking as the snapping on and off of electricity, sitting there 
and talking and now Grandfather not knowing what he was 
talkii^ about because now Grandfather said he did not be- 
lieve that Sutpen himself knew because even yet Sutpen had 
not quite told him all of it. And this that morality again, 
Grandfather said: that morality whidi would not permit him 
to malign or traduce the memory of his first wife, or at least 
the memory of rite marriage even though he felt that he had 
been tricked by it, not even to an acquaintance in whose con- 
fidence and discretion he trusted enough to wish to justify 
himself, not even to his son by another marriage in order to 
preserve the status of his life’s attainment and desire, except 
as a last resort. Not that he would hesitate then. Grandfather 
said: but not until then. had been tricked by it himself, 
but he had octricated himself without asking or receiving 
help fiom any man; let anyone else who might be so imposed 
i^pon do the same. — Sitting there and moralizing on the fict 
diat, no matter which course he chose, the lesult would be 
that that deagn and plan to which he Bad given fifty years of 
his lift had just as wdQ. newr have existed at all by almost 
exactly fifty years, and Grmdfather not knowing what 
ch(^ he was talking about even, what second choice he 
was faced with until the very last word he spoke before he 
got up and put on his hat and shook Grandfather’s left hand 
mi rode away; this second choitte, need to dioose, as obscure 
to Grandfather as the rei^n for the first, the repudiation, had 
been: so that Grandfather did not even say ‘I dont know 
which you should choose’ not because that was all he t^uld 
have sa^ and so to say that would be less dm no answer at 
• 



all, but that anydung he might have said would have been 
less t han no answer at all s inc e Su^en was not listenmg, did 
not expect an answer, who had not come for pit)’ and there 
was no advice that he could have taken, and justification he 
had already coerced from his conscience thirty years ago. 
And he still knew that he had courage, and diough he may 
have come to doubt lately that he had acquired that shrewd- 
ness which at one time he believed he had, he still believed 
that it existed somewhere in the world to be Iftamf d and that 
if it could be learned he would yet learn it— and maybe even 
this, Grandfather said: if shrewdness could not extricate bim 
this second time as it had before, he could at least depend on 
the courage to find him will and strength to make a third 
start toward that design as it had found him to make the 
second witli — who came into the office not for pity and not 
for help because Grandfather said he had never learned how 
to ask anybody for help or anything else and so he would not 
have known what to do with the help if Grandffither could 
have given it to hi m , but came just with that sober and quiet 
bemusement, hoping maybe (ffihe hoped at all, if he were 
doing anything but just thinking out loud at all) that thcl^al 
mind mi|^t peredve and darify that mirial mistake which he 
still insisted on, which he himself had not been able to find: 
*1 was faced with condoning a feet which had been foisted 
upon me without my knowledge during the process of build- 
ing toward my design, which meant the absolute and irre- 
vocable negation of the design; or in holding to my ori^nal 
plan for the design in pursuit of whidi I had incurred this ne- 
^tion. I chose, and I made to dhe fullest what atonement lay 
in my power for whatever injury I might have done in 
choedng, paying even more for the privilege of chocsing as 
I ch(^ than 1 might have been oq&gt;ected to, or even ^y law) 
requited. Yet I am now foced with a sea&gt;nd necessity to 

273 



choose, the cunous factor of which is not, as you pointed oitt 
and as first appeared to me, that the necessity for a new choice 
should have arisen, but that either choice which I might make, 
either course which I might choose, leads to the same result: 
eidier I destroy my design with my own hand, which will 
happen if I am forced to play my last trump card, or do noth- 
ing, let matters take the course which I know they will take 
and see my design complete itself quite normally and natu- 
rally and successfully to the public eye, yet to my own in 
such fashion as to be a mockery and a betrayal of that littk 
boy who approached that door fifty years ago and was mmed 
away, for whose vindication the whole plan was conceived 
and carried forward to the moment of this choice, this second 
choice devolving out of that first one which in its turn was 
forced on me as the result of an agreement, an arrangement 
which I had entered in good faith, concealing nothing, while 
die other party or parties to it concealed from me the one 
very factor which would destroy the entire plan and design 
which I had been working toward, concealed it so well that 
it was not until after the child was bom that I discovered chat 
this factor edsted’ ” 

“Your old man,” Shreve said. “When your grand&amp;dier 
was telling this to him, he didn’t know any more what yoar 
grandfather was talking about than your grand&amp;dier knew 
what the demon was talking about when the demon told it 
to him, did he? And when your old man told it to you, you 
wouldn’t have known what anybody was talking abotm if 
you hadn’t been out there and seen Clytie. Is that right?” 

“Yes,” Quentin said. “Grandfether was the only fi:knd he 
had.” 

“Ihe demon had?” Quendn didn’t answer, didn’t move. 
It was cold in the room now. The heat was alm(»t gone out 
of the ladkcors: the cold iron fiuting stem s^oal and admoni-

don for sleeping, the litde death, the renewaL It had been 
some time now since the chimes had rung eleven. “All 
right,” Shreve said. He "was hugging himself into the bath- 
robe now as he had formerly hugged himself inside his pink 
naked almost hairless skin. “He chose. He chose lechery. So 
do 1. But go on.” His remark was not intended for flippancy 
nor even derogation. It was bom (if from any source) of that 
incorrigible unsentimental sentimentality of die young which 
the form of hard and often crass levity — to which, by 
the way, Quentin paid no attention whatever, resuming as 
if he had never been interrupted, his face still lowered, still 
brooding apparendy on the open letter upon the open book 
between his hands. 

“He left for Virginia that night. Grandfather said how he 
went to the window and watched him ride across the square 
on the gaunt black stallion, erect in his faded gray, the hat 
with its broken plume cocked a htde yet not quite so much 
as the beaver of the old days, as if (Grandfather said) even 
with his martial rank and prerogatives he did not quite swag- 
ger h'lcp he used to do, not because he was chastened by mis- 
fortune or spent or even war-wcaried but as though even 
while riding he was still bemused in that state in which he 
struggled to hold clear and free above a maelstrom of un- 
predictable and unreasoning human beings, not his head for 
breath and not so much his fifty years of effort and striving 
to establish a posterity, but his code of logic and morakty, 
his formula and recipe of fact and deduction whose balanced 
sum and product declined, refused to swim or even float. 
Grandfather saw him approadi the Holston House and saw 
old Mr McCaslin and two other old men hobble out and 
stop him, he sitting ihe stallion and talking to them and his 
voice not raised, Grandfafoer said, yet the very sober qu^ty 
of his gestures and die set of his should forensic, oratorical 

375 



TheQ he went on. He could still reach Sutpen’s Hundred be- 
fore dark, so it was probably after supper than he headed the 
stallion toward the Atlantic Ocean, he and Judith facing one 
another again for maybe a full minute, he not needing to say 
‘I will stop it if I can,’ she not needing to say ‘Stop it then — 
if you can’ but just goodbye, the kiss on the brow and no 
tears; a word to Clyde and to Wash: master to slave, baron 
to retainer: ‘Well, Clyde, take care of Miss JuditL — ^Wash, 
rU send you a piece of Abe Lincoln’s coat tail from Wash- 
ington’ and I reckon Wash answering like it used to be under 
the scuppemongs with the demijohn and the well bucket; 
‘Sho, Kernel; kill ever one of the varmints!’ So he ate the 
hoecake and drank the parched acorn coffee and rode away. 
Then it was ’65 and the army (Grandfather had gone back to 
it too; he was a brigadier now though I reckon this was for 
more reason than because he just had one arm) had retreated 
across Georgia and into Carolina and they all knew it 
wouldn’t be very much longer now. Then one day Lee sent 
johnston some reinforcements from one of his corps and 
Grandfather found out that the Twenty-third Mississippi was 
one of the regiments. And he (Grandfather) didn’t know 
what had happened: whether Sutpen had found out in some 
way that Henry had at last coerced his conscience into agree- 
ing with him as his (Henry’s) father had done thirty years 
ago, whether Judith perhaps W written her father that she 
had heard from Bon at last and what she and Bon intended to 
do, or if the ftiur of them had just reached as one person that 
point where something had to be done, had to happen, he 
(Gran^ther) didn’t know. He just learned one morning that 
Sutpen had ridden up to Grandfather’s old regiment’s head- 
quarters and asked and received permission to speak to Henry 
and did sf^ak to him and then rode away again before mid- 
nig^”

“So he got his choice made, after all,” Shreve said. “He 
played that trump after ali And so he camp home and 
found 

“Wait,” Quentin said. 

“ what he must have wanted to find or anyway what 

he was going to find ” 

“Wait, I tell you!” Quentin said, though still he did not 
move nor even raise his voice — that voice with its tense 
suffused restrained quality: “I am telling” Am I going to have 
to have to hear it all again he thought I am going to have to hear 
it all over again I am already hearing it all over again I listen- 
ing to it all over again I shall have to never listen to anything else 
but this again forever so (^patently not only a man never outlives 
his father but not even his friends and acquaintances do — ^he came 
home and found that at least regarding which he should have 
needed no word nor warning even if Judith would have sast 
him one, sent him acknowledgnaent that she was beatm, 
who according to Mr Compson would no more have sent 
Hm acknowledgment that he had beat her than she waited 
(whom Miss Coldfield said was not bereaved) and met him 
on his return, not with the fury and despair perhaps which he 
might have expected evai thoi^ knowing as litde, having 
learned as litde, about womai as Mr Compson said he had, 
yet certainly with something other than the icy calm wah 
winch, according to Miss Coldfield, she met him — die kiss 
again after almost two yean, on the brow; the voices, the 

speeches, quiet, contained, almost impersonal: ‘And i 

‘Yes. Henry killed him* followed by the brief tears which 
ceased on dm instant when they began, as if the moisture 
consisted of a single dieet or layer t^ as a cigarette paper 
and in the diape of a human face; the *Ah, Clytie. Ah,

ised you’; the (from Jones) guffaw, the chortle, the old im- 
becile stability of the articulated mud which, Mr Compson 
said, outlasts the victories and the defeats both: ‘Well, Kernel 
they kilt us but they aint whupped us yit, air they?’: and that 
was all. He had returned. He was home again where his 
problem now was haste, passing time, the need to hurry. He 
was not concerned, Mr Compson said, about the courage and 
the will, nor even about the shrewdness now. He was not for one 
moment concerned about his ability to start the third time. All that 
he was concerned about was the possibility that he might not have 
time sufficient to do it in, regain his lost ground in. He did not 
waste any of what time he had either. The will and the shrewdtiess 
too he did not waste, though he doubtless did not consider it to have 
been either his will or his shrewdness which supplied waiting to 
his hand the opportunity, and it ivas probably less of shrewdness 
and more of courage than even will which got him engaged to Miss 
Rosa within a period of three months and almost before she was 
aware of the fact— Miss Rosa, die chief disciple and advocate of 
that cult of demon-harrying of which he was the chief object [even 
though not victim), engaged to him before she had got accustomed 
to having him in the house — yes, more of courege than even will, 
yet something of shrewdness too: the shrewdness acquired in ex- 
mttiating Ablets through the fifty years suddenly capitdant and 
retroactive or suddenly sprouting and flotvering like a seed lain 
fallow in a vacuum or in a single iron clod. Because he seemed to 
perceive widtout stopping, in that passage through the house ivhuh 
was an unbroken continueUion of the long journey from Virginia, 
the pause not to greet his family but merely to pick up Jones and 
drag him on ota to the brier-^oked fields and fdlen fences and 
dap ax or mattock into fus hands, the one weedi spot, die one spot 
vulnerable to assault in Miss Rosa's embattled spinsterhood, and 
to assault &lt;md carry this in one stride, with something of the ndk- 
*ess ttudcal ddU of his old master [die Twenty-third Msstteipffi 

ays 



was in Jacksons corps at one time)* And then the shrewdness failed 
him again. It broke down, it vanished into that old impotent logic 
and morality which had betrayed him before: md what day might 
it have been, what furrow might he have stopped dead in, one foot 
advanced, the unsentient plow handles in his instantaneous uu-* 
sentient hands, what fence panel held in midair as though it had no 
weight by muscles which could not feel it, token he realized that 
there was more in his problem than just lack of time, that the prob- 
lem contained some super-distillation of this lack: that he was now 
past sixty and that possibly he could get but one more son, had at 
best but one more son in his loins, as the old cannon might know 
when it has just one more shot in its corporeality. So he suggested 
what he suggested to her, and she did ivhat he should have known 
she would do and would have known probably if he had not bogged 
himself again in his morality' which had all the parts but which 
refused to run, to move. Hence the proposal, the outrage and un- 
belief; the tide, the blast of indignation and anger upon which 
Miss Rosa vanished from Suipens Hundred, her air-ballooned 
skirts spread upon the flood, chip-light, her bonnet {possibly one 
of Ellens which she had prowled out of the atiic) clapped fast onto 
her head rigid and precarious with rage. Afid he standing there with 
Ate reins over his arm, with perhaps something like smiling inside 
his beard and about the eyes tvhich was not smiling hut the crinkled 
concentration of furious thinking — the haste, the need far it; the 
urgency but not fear, not concern: just the fact that he had missed 
that time, though luckily it was just a spoUing shot with a light 
charge, and the old gun, the old barrel and carriage none the worse; 
only next time there might not be enough powder for both a spotting 
shot and then a full-sized had— the fad that the thread of shrewd^ 
ness and courage and will ran onto the same spool which the thread 
of his remaining days ran onto and that spool almost near enough 
for him to reach out his hand md touch it. But this was no ^ave 
concern yet, since it {the old logic, the old morality which had 

279 



never yet failed to fail him) was already ftdling into pattern, al- 
ready showing him conclusively that he had been right, jua as he 
kftew he had been, and therefore what had happened was jmt a 
delusion and did not actually exist. 

“No,” Shreve said; “you wait. Let me pky a wMe now. 
Now, Wash. Him (die demon) standing there with the horse, 
the saddled charger, dhe sheathed saber, the gray waiting to 
be laid peaceful away among the modis and all lost save dis- 
honor: then the voice of the faithful grave-digger who 
opened the pky and would dose it, coming out of the wings 
like Shakespeare’s very self: ‘Well, Kernel, diey mought 

have whupped us but they aint kilt us yit, air dxey?’ ” 

This was not flippancy either. It too was just that protective 
coloring of levity behind which the youthful shame of being 
moved hid itself, out of which Quentin also spoke, the reason 
for Quentin’s sullen bemusement, the (on both their parts) 
flipness, the strained clowning: the two of them, whether 
they knew it or not, in the cold room (it was quite cold now) 
dedicated to that b^ of ratiocination which after all was a 
good deal like Sutpai’s morality and Miss Coldfield’s de- 
monizing— this room not only dedicated to it but set aside 
for it and suitably so since it would be here abqve any other 
place that it (the logic and the morality) could do the least 
ambunt of harm — ^the two of them bade to back as though at 
the last ditch, saying No to Quentin’s Mississippi shade who 
m life had acted and reacted to the minimum of logic and 
morality, who dying had escaped it completdy, who dead 
remained not only mdifferent but impervious to it, somehow 
a thousand times more potent and alive. There was no harm 
mtended by Shreve and no harm taken, dnee Quoitin did 
not even stop. He did not even fdter, taking Shreve up in 
strkk without comma or colon or par^;rapht 

" no reserve to risk a spotting shot with now so he 

%So 



started this one like you start a rabbit out of a brier patch, 
•with, a little chunk of dried mud thrown, by hand. Maybe it 
was the first string of beads out of his and Wash’s little store 
where he would get mad at his customers, the niggen and 
the trash and the haggling, and turn them out and lock the 
door and drink himself blind. And maybe Wash delivered 
the beads himselfi Father said, that was down at the gate 
when he rode back firom the war that day, that after he went 
away with the regiment would teE folks that he (W ash) was 
loo^g after Kernel’s place and niggers imtil after a while 
maybe he even believed it. Father’s mother said how when 
the Sutpen niggers fint heard about what he was saying, they 
would stop him in the road that came up out of the bottom 
where the old fishing camp was that Sutpai let him and the 
granddaughter (she was about eight then) live in. There 
would be too many of them for him to whip them aD, to 
even try to, risk trying to: and they would ask him why he 
wasn’t at the war and he would say, ‘Git outen my road, 
niggers!’ and then it would be the outright lau^iing, asking 
one another (except it was not one another but him): ‘Who 
him, calling us n^gerst’ and he would rush at them with a 
stick and them avoiding him just enough, not mad at all, just 
laughing. And he was stifl carrying fifti and animals he kiEed 
(or maybe stole) and vegetables up to the house when that 
was about aU Mrs Sutpen and Judith (and Clyde too) 
had to live on, and Clyde would not let him come into the 
kitchen with the basket even, saying, ‘Stop right there, white 
man. Stop right where you is. You aint never crossed this 
door while Colonel was here and you aint going to cross it 
now.* Which was true, only Father said there was a kind of 
prick in it: that he had never tried to enter the house, even 
A ftHg h he believed that if he had tried, Sutpen would not 
have let them repulse him- like (Father said) he mi^t have 

28 x 



said to himself The reason I wont try it aint that I refuse to give 
any black nigger the chance to tell me I cant hut because I amt go- 
ing to force Mister Tom to have to cuss a nigger or take a cussing 
from his wife on my account. But they would dnnk together 
under the scuppemong arbor on the Sunday afternoons, and 
on the week days he would see Sutpen (the fine figure of the 
man as he caUed it) on the black stallion, galloping about the 
plantation, and Father said how for that moment Wash’s 
heart would be quiet and proud both and that maybe it would 
seem to him that this world where niggers, that the Bible 
said had been created and cursed by God to be brute and vas- 
sal to all men of white skin, were better found and housed 
and e\'en clothed than he and his granddaughter — that this 
world where he walked always in mocking and jeermg 
echoes of nigger laughter, was just a dream and an illusion 
and that the actual world was the one where his own lonely 
apotheosis (Father said) galloped on the black thoroughbred, 
thinking maybe, Father said, how the Book said that all men 
were created in the image of God and so all men were the 
same in God’s eyes anyway, looked the same to God at least, 
and so he would look at Sutpen and think A fine proud man. 
If Cod Himself was to come down and ride the natural earth, thaCs 
what He would aim to look like. Maybe he even delivered the 
first string of beads himself, and Father said maybe each of 
the nbbons afterward during the next three ye^s while the 
girl matured fiist like girls of that kind do; or anyway he 
would know and recognize each and every ribbon when he 
saw it on her even when she lied to him about where md 
how she got it, which she probably did not, since she would 
be bound to know that he had been seeing dte ribbons in the 
diowcase every day for three years and would have known 
them as well as he knew hft own shoes. And not tmly he 
knew them, but all the other men, the customers and the 
aSz 



loungers, the white and the bkck that would be sitting and 
squatting about the store’s gallery to watch her pass, not quite 
defiant and not quite cringing and not quite flaunong the 
nbbons and the beads, but almost; not quite any of them but 
a little of all: bold, sullen and fearful. But father said how 
Wash’s heart was probably soil quiet even after he saw the 
dress and spoke about it, probably only a little grave now 
and watching her secret defiant frightened face while she told 
him (before he had asked, maybe too insistent, too quick to 
volunteer it) that Miss Judith had given it to her, helped her 
to make it: and Father said maybe he realized all of a sudden 
and without warning tliat when he passed the men on the 
gallery they would look after him too and that tliey already 
knew that which he had just thought they were probably 
think ing. But Father said his heart was soil quiet, even now, 
and that he answered, if he answered at all, stopped the pro- 
testations and disclaimers at all: ‘Sho, now. Ef Kernel and 
Miss Judith wanted to give hit to you, I hope you minded to 
thank them.’ — ^Not alarmed. Father said: just houghtful, 
just grave; and Father said how that afternoon Grandfether 
rode out to see Sutqien about something and there was no- 
body in the front of the store and he w'as about to go out and 
go up to the house when he heard the voices from the back 
and he walked on toward them and so he overheard them 
before he could begin to not listen and before he could make 
them hear him calling Sutpen’s name. Grandfather couldn’t 
see them yet, he hadn’t even got to where they could hear 
him yet, but he said he knew exaedy how they would be: 
Sutpen having already told Wash to get the jug out and then 
Wash spoke and Sutpen beginning to turn, rea lizin g that 
W ash wasn’t getting the jug before he comprehended the im- 
port of what Wash was saying, dien comprehendmg that and 
still half turned and then all of a sudden kind of reared back 

283 



and flinging his head up, looking at Wash and Wash stand- 
ing there, not cringing either, in thtU; attitude dogged and 
quiet and not cringing, and Sutpen said, ‘What about the 
dress?’ and Grandfather said it was Sutpen’s voice that was 
short and sharp: not Wash’s; that Wash’s voice was just flat 
and quiet, not abject: just patient and slow: ‘I have knowed 
you for going on twenty years now. I aint never denied yit 
to do what you told me to do. And I’m a man past sixty. 
And she aim nothing but a fifteen-year-old gal.’ and Sutpen 
said, ‘Meaning that I’d harm the girl? I, a man as old as you 
arc?’ and Wash: ‘If you was arra other man. I’d say you was 
as old as me. And old or no old, I wouldn’t let her keep that 
dress nor nothing else that come from your hand. But you are 
diflerent.* and Sutpen: ‘How different?’ and Grandfather said 
how Wash did not answer and that he called again now and 
neither of them heard him; and then Sutpen said: ‘So that’s 
why you are afraid of me?’ and Wash said, ‘I aint afraid. Be- 
cause you are brave. It aint that you were a brave man at one 
second or minute or hour of your life and got a paper to show 
hit fiom General Lee. But you are brave, the same as you are 
alive and breathing. That’s vshere it’s different. Hit rhjnt need 
no ticket from nobody to tell me that And 1 know that 
whatever your hands tech, whether hit’s a lepmmt of men 
or a ignorant gal or just a hound dog, that you will make hit 
right’ Then Grandfather heard Sutpen move, sudden and 
sharp, and Grandfather said he reckoned, thought just about 
what he imagined Wash was thinking. But all Sutpoi said 
was, ‘Get the jug.*— ‘Sho, Kernel,’ Wash said. 

“So that Sunday came, a year after that day and three years 
after he had suggested to Mm Rosa that they try it first and 
if it was a boy and lived, they would be married. It was be- 
fore day%ht and he was expecting his mare to foal to the 
black stallitm, so when he kft the house before day that motn- 
384 



jug Judith thought he was gomg to the stabk. What Jtdith 
knew and how much about her father and Wash’s grand.- 
daughter nobody knew, how much she could not have 
helped but know from what Clyde must have known (may 
have or may not have told her, whether or no) since every- 
body else white or black in the neighborhood knew who 
had ever seen the girl pass in the ribbons and be^ which 
they all recognized, how much she may have refused to dis- 
cover during the fitting and sewing of that dress (Father 
said Judith actually did this; this was no lie that the girl told 
Wash: the two of them alone all day long for about a week 
in the house: and what they must have talked about, what 
Judith must have talked about while the girl stood around in 
what she possessed to call underclothes, with her sullen de- 
fiant secret watchful face, answering what, telling what that 
Judith may or may not have tried to shut her eyes to, nobody 
knew). So it was not until he &amp;iled to return at dinner time 
t hat she went or sent Clytie to the stable and found that the 
mar e had foakd in the night but that her fether was not there. 
And it was not until midaftemoon that she found a half* 
grown boy and paid him a nidkel to go down to the old fish 
ramp and ask Wash where Sutpen was, and the boy walked 
whistling around the comer of the rotting cabin and saw 
maybe die scythe first, maybe the body first lying in the 
weeds wbidh Wash had not yet cut, and as he screamed he 
Inriked up and saw Wash in the window, watching h^ 
Then about a week later they caught thenigger, the midwife, 
flttd she told how she didn’t know that Wash was there at all 
that dawn when she heard the horse and then Sutpen s feet 
and he ramr in and stood over the pallet where the gjr^ and 

the baby were and sdd, ‘Penelope * (that was the mare) 

* foaled this morning. A damned fine colt- Going to be 

die spit and image of his (Mdy when I rode him North in 

385 



’6i. Do you remembers’ and the old nigger said she said, 
‘Yes, Marster’ and that he jerked the riding whip toward the 
pallet and said, ‘Wells Damn your black hide: horse or 
mares' and that she told him and that he stood there for a 
minute and he didn’t move at all, with the riding whip 
^lainst his leg and the lattices of sunlight firom the unchinked 
wall falling upon him, across his white hair and his beard 
that hadn’t turned at all yet, and she said she saw his eyes and 
then his teeth inside his beard and that she would have run 
then only she couldn’t, couldn’t seem to make her le^ bear 
to gpt up and run: and then he looked at the girl on the pallet 
again and said, ‘Well, Milly; too bad you’re not a marc too. 
Then I could give you a decent stall in the stable’ and turned 
and went out. Only she could not move even yet, and she 
didn’t even know that Wash was outside there; she just 
heard Sutpen say, ‘Stand back, WasL Don’t you touch me, 
and then Wash, his voice soft and hardly loud enough to 
reach her: ‘I’m going to tech you. Kernel’ : and Sutpen again: 
‘Stand back. Wash!’ sharp now, and then she heard the whip 
on Wash’s fitce but she didn’t know if she heard the scythe 
or not because now she found out that she could move, get 

up, run out of the cabin and into the weeds, running 

“Wait,” Shteve said; “wait. You mean that he had got 

the son at last that he wanted, yet still he ” 

“ walked the three miles and back before midnight 

tX3 fetch the old nigger, then sat on the sagging gallery until 
dayl%ht came and the granddaughter stopped screaming 
inside the aibin and he even heard the baby once, waiting 
for Sutpen. And Father said his heart was quiet then too, 
even though he knew what they would be saying in every 
cabin about the land by nightfell, just as he had known what 
they were saying daring the last four or five months while 
his granddaughter’s condition (which he had never tried to 
286 



conceal) could no longer be mistaken: Wash Jones has fixed 
old Sutpen at last. It ta^n him tiventy years to do it, hut he has 
got a holt of old Sutpen at last where Sutpen will either have to 
tear meat or squeal That’s what Father said he was thinking 
while he waited outside on the gallery where the old nigger 
had sent him, ordered him out, standing there maybe by the 
very post where the scythe had leaned rusting for two years, 
while the granddat^hter’s screams came steady as a clock 
now but his own heart quiet, not at all concerned not 
alarmed; and Father said that maybe while he stood bc~ 
fogged in his fumbling and groping {that morality of his 
that was a good deal like Sutpen’s, that told him he was 
right in the fece of all fact and usage and everything else) 
which had always been somehow mixed up and involved 
with galloping hoofs even during the old peace that nobody 
remembered, and in which durii^ the four years of die war 
which he had not attended the gallopiog had been only the 
more gallant and proud and thimderous — ^Father said that 
maybe he got his answer; that maybe there broke free and 
plain in midgallop against the yellow sky of dawn die fine 
proud image of the man on the fine proud image of die stal- 
Hon and tint the fumbling and the groping broke dear and 
free too, not in justification or es^lanation or extenuation or 
excme. Father said, but as the apotheosis lonely, explicable, 
beyond all human fouling: He is higger than edl them Yankees 
that killed us and ourn, that killed his tvife and widowed his 
daughter and druv his son from home, that stole his mggers and 
ruined his land; bigger than this whole county that he fit for and 
in payment for which has brung him to keeping a little country 
store for his bread and meat; bigger than the scorn cmd denial which 
hit belt to his Ups like the Um cup in the Book. And how amid I 
have lived nigh to him for twenty years without beir^ touched and 
dumged by him? May^ I am not as big as he is mtd mafite I did 

as? 



not do my of tlie galloping. But at least I was drug along where he 
wetti. And me and him can still do hit and will ever so, if so be he 
will show me what he aims for me to do; and maybe soli standing 
diere and holding the stallion’s reins after Sntpen had entered 
the cabin, still hearing the galloping, watching the proud 
galloping image merge and pass, galloping through avatars 
which marked the accumulation of years, time, to the fine 
climax where it galloped without weariness or progress, for- 
ever and forever immortal beneath the brandished saber and 
the diot-tom flags rushing down a sky in color like thunder; 
stood there and h^d Sutpen inside the house speak his single 
sentence of salutation, inquiry and farewell to tie grand- 
daughter, and Father said diat for a second Wash must not 
have felt the very earth under his feet while he watched Sut- 
pen emei^e firom the house, the riding whip in his hand, 
thinking quietly, like in a dream: I kaint have heard what I 
know I heard. I just know I kaint thinking TTuU was what got 
him up. It was that coIl It mnt me or mine either. It wasn't even 
his own that gat him out of bed maybe feeling no earth, no 
stability, even yet, maybe not even hearing his own voice 
when Sutpen saw bus fece (the face of the man who in twenty 
years he had no more known to make any move save at 
command than he had the stallion which he rode) and 
sto^)ed: ‘You said if she was a mare you could give her a 
decent stall in the stable,* maybe not even hearing Sutpen 
when he said, sudden and sharp: ‘Stand back. Dont you 
touch me’ only he mint have heard ftiat because he answered 
k: ‘I’m going to tech you. Kernel’ and Sutpen said ‘Stand 
back. Wash* before the oM woman heard the vsdiip. 
Only thae wece: two bfows with the whip; they found the 
two wdts on Wash’s fece thsa: night. Maybe the two blows 
even knocked him down; maybe k was while he was getting 
flbat.he hk on the scythe ” 



“Wait,” Slireve said; “for Christ’s sake wait You mean 
that he ” 

“ sat there ail that day in the Ktde window where he 

could watch the road; probably laid the scythe down and 
went straight into the house where maybe the granddaughter 
on the pallet asked querulously what it was and he answered, 
WhutJ Whut racket, honeyt’ and maybe he tried to per- 
suade her to eat too — ^the ade meat he had probably brought 
home from the store Saturday night or maybe die candy, 
trying to tempt her with it maybe — the nickel's worth of 
stale jellified glue out of a striped sack, and maybe ate and 
then sat at the window where he could look out above the 
body and the scythe in the weeds below, and watch the road. 
Because he was sitting there when the half grown boy came 
around the comer of the house whistling and saw him. And 
Father said he must have reahVed dim that it would not be 
much after dark when it would happen; that he must have 
sat there and sensed, felt them gathering with the horses and 
dogs and guns — ^the curious and the vengeful — ^men of Sut- 
pen’s own kind, who used to eat at his table with him bade 
when he (Wash) had yet to approach nearer the house than 
the scuppemong arbor — ^men who had led the way, diown 
the other and lesser ones how to fight in batdes, who might 
also possess agned papers from the generals saying that they 
were among the first and foremost of the brave — who had 
galloped also in the old days arrogant and proud on the fine 
horses about the fine plantations — symbol also of admiration 
and hope, instruments too of despair and grief; these it was 
whom he was expected to run from and it seeming to him 
probably that he had no less to run from than he had to tun 
to; that if he ran he would be fledng merdy one set of brag- 
ging and evil shadows for another, since they (men) were all 
of a kind throu^out all of earth wludh he knew, and he old, 

280 



too old to nm far even if he were to run who could never 
escape diem, no matmr how much or how far he ran; a man 
past sixty could not expeo: to run that far, far enough to es- 
cape beyond the boundaries of earth where such men lival, 
set the order and the rule of living: and Father said that may- 
be for the first time in his life he began to compreheid how 
it had beai possible for Yankees or any odber army to have 
whipped them — the gallant, theproud, the brave; the acknow- 
ledged and chosen best among them all to bear the course 
and honor and pride. It would probably be about sunset now 
and probably he could feel them quite near now; Father said 
it probably seemed to him diat he could even hear them: all 
the voices, the murmuring of tomorrow and tomorrow and 
tomorrow beyond the immediate fury: Old Wash Jones come 
a tumble at last. He thought he had Sutpen, hut Sutpen fooled him. 
He dwught he had him, but old Wash Jones got fooled and then 
maybe even saying it aloud, shouting it Father said: ‘But I 
never esqpected that. Kernel! You know I never!* untilmay- 
be the granddaughter stirred and spoke querulously again 
and he went and quieted her and returned to talk to himself 
again but careful now, quiet now since Sutpen was dose 
enough to hear him easy, without shouting: ‘You know I 
never. You know I never expected or asked or wanted noth- 
ing from arra living man but what I ocpected from you. 
And I never a^ed that. I didn’t diinfc hit would need: I jmt 
said to myself I dont need to. What need has a fellow like Wash 
Jones to question or doubt the man that Genertd Lee himself said 
in a hand-wrote ticket that he was braee? Brave’ (and maybe it 
would be loud again, forgetting again} ‘Brave ! Better if nam 
one of them had ever rid ba&lt;i in ’65’ thinking Better if his 
idnd and mine too had never drawn the breath of life on this earth. 
Better duO. all who remain of us be blasted from the face &lt;f it tfum 
diM atu^her Wash Jones should see bis whole life shredded from 
390 



him and shrivel away like a dried shuck tbrowti onto the fire Then 
they rode up. Ee must have been listening to them as they 
came down the road, the dogs and the horses, and seen the 
lanterns since it was dark now'. And M^or de Spam who was 
sheriff then got dowm and saw the body, though he said he 
did not see Wash nor know that he was there unol Wash 
spoke his name quiedy from the ■window almost in his face: 
‘That you. Major?’ De Spain told him to come on out and 
he said how Wash’s voice was quite quiet when he said he 
would be out in just a minute; it was too quiet, too calm; so 
much too quiet and calm that de Spain said he did not realize 
for a moment that it was too calm and quiet: ‘In just a 
minute. Soon as I see about my granddaughter.’ ‘We’ll see 
to her,’ de Spain said. ‘You come on out.’ ‘Sho, Major,’ 
Wash said, ‘In just a minute.’ So they waited in front of the 
dark house, and the next day Father said there were a hun- 
dred that remembered about the butdrer knifr that he k^t 
hidden and razor-sharp — die one thing in his sloven life that 
he "was ever kno'wn to take pritfe in or care of— only by the 
time they remembered all this it was too kte. So they dida’ t 
know what he was about. They just heard him moving in- 
side the dark house, then they heard the granddaughter's 
voice, fretful and querulous: ‘Who is it? Light the lamp, 
Grandpaw’ then his voice: ‘Hit wont need no light, honey. 
Hit wont take but a minut e’ then de Spain drew his pistol 
and said, ‘You, Wash! Come out of there!’ and still Wash 
didn’t answer, murmuring still to the granddaughter: ‘Wher 
air you?’ and the fretful voice answering, ‘Right here. Where 

else would I be? What is * then de Spain said, ‘Jones!’ 

and he ■was already fumbling at the broken steps when the 
granddaughter screamed; and now all the men there claimed 
that diey heard the knife on both the neckbones, though de 
Spain didn’t. He just said he knew that Wash had come out 


291 



oaKJ tlie gallery and that he sprang back before he found out 
that it was not toward him Wash was running but toward the 
end of the gallery, where the body lay, but that he did not 
think about the scythe: he just ran backward a few feet whai 
he saw Wash stoop and rise again and now Wash was run- 
ning toward him. Only he was running toward them all, de 
Spain said, running into the lanterns so that now they could 
see the scythe raised above his head; they could see his face, 
his eyes too, as he ran with the scythe above his head, stra^ht 
into the lanterns and the gun barrels, making no sound, no 
outcry while de Spain ran backward before him, saying, 
‘Jones! Stop! Stop, or I’ll kill you. Jones! Jonra! Jones!”’ 

“Wait,” Shreve said. “You mean that he got the son he 
wanted, after all that trouble, and then turned right around 
and ” 

“Yes. Sitting in Grandfather’s office that afternoon, with 
his head kind of dung back a little, explaining to Grandfather 
like he might have been explaining arithmetic to Henry back 
in the fourth grade: ‘You see, all I wanted was just a son. 
Which seems to me, when I look about at my contemporary 
scene, no exorbitant gift from nature or circumstance to 
demand 

‘’Witt you wait?” Shreve said. “ that with the son he 

went to all that trouble to get lying right there behind him 
in the cabin, he would have to taunt the grandfether into 
killing first him and then the child toot” 

“ — - Whatt” Quentin said. “It wasn’t a son. It was a 

girr* 

“Oh,” Shreve said. “ Come on. Let’s grt out of this

There would be no deep breathing tonight. The 
window would remain closed above the firozen and empty 
quad beyond which the windows in the opposite wall were, 
with two or three exceptions, already dark; soon the chimes 
would ring for midnight, die notes melodious and tranquil, 
f^t and dear as glass in the fierce (it had quit snowing) still 
air. “So the old man sent the nigger for Henry,” Shreve 
said. *‘And Henry canae in and the old man, said ‘They can- 
not marry because he is your brother’ and Henry said ‘You 
lie* like that, that quick: no ^ace, no interval, no nothbg 
between like when you press Ac button and get fight in the 
room. And the old man just sat there, didn’t even move and 
strike him and so Henry didn’t say *¥00 fie’ again because he 
knew now it was so; he just said ‘It’s not true,’ not ‘I dont 
believe it’ but ‘It’s not true’ because he could maybe see the 
old man’s fice ^ain now and demon or no it was a kind of 
grief and pity, not for himself but for Henry, because Henry 
was just young while he (the did man) knew that he still had 

the courage and even all the shrewdness too 

Shreve stood beside the table, facing Quenrin again though 
not seated now. In the overcoat buttoned awry over the 
bathrobe he looked huge and shapeless like a disheveled bear 
as he stared at Quentin (the Southerner, whose blood ran 
quick to cool, more supple to compensate for violent changes 
of temperature peihaps, perha|» merely nearer the surface) 


who sat huQclied in Ids chair, his hands thrust into his podbets 
as if he were trying to hug himself warm between hh arms, 
looking somehow fragile and even wan in the lamplight, the 
rosy glow which now had nothing of warmth, coziness, in 
it, while both their breathing vaporized fnntly in the cold 
room where there was now not two of them but four, the 
two who breathed not individuals now yet something both 
more and less than twins, the heart and blood of youtL 
Shreve was nineteai, a few months younger than Quentin. 
He looked exactly nineteen; he was one of those people 
whose correct age you never know because they look es- 
acdy that and so you teE yourself that he or she cannot pos- 
sibly be that because he or she looks too exactly that not to 
take advantage of the appearance: so you never believe im- 
plicitly that he or she is either that age which diey claim or 
that which in sheer desperation they agree to or which some- 
one else reports them to be, strong enou^ and willing 
enough for two, for two thousand, for alL Not two of them 
in a New England college sitting-room but one in a Missis- 
sippi library sixty y eare ago, with holly and mistletoe in vases 
on the mantel or thrust behind, crowning and garlanding 
with the season and time the pictures on the waEs, and a sprig 
or so d«:orating the photograph, the group — smother and 
two drildren— on the desk, behind whkh the fether sat when 
foe son entered; and they — Quentin and Shreve — foinlring 
how after foe fofoer spoke and before what he said stopp^ 
bemg shock and began to make sense, Henry would recall 
later how he had seen through foe window beyond his fefoer’s 
head foe sister and foe lover in foe garden, pacing slowly, 
foe-sister’s head bent with listening, foe lover’s head leaned 
above it while they paced slowly on in that rhythm which 
nee foye eyes but foe heart marks and calls foe beat and meas- 
ure for, to disappear slowly beyond some bufo or shnfo

starred ■with white bloom— jasmine, spiraea, honeysuckle, 
perhaps myriad scentless unpickable Cherokee roses — ^names, 
blooms which Shrcve possibly had never heard and never 
seen although the air had blown over him first ■which be- 
came tempered to nourish them. It would not matter here 
in Cambridge that the time had been ■winter in that garden 
too, and hence no bloom nor leaf even if there had been 
someone to ■walk there and be seen there since, judged by 
subsequent events, it had been night in the garden also. But 
that did not matter because it had been so long ago. It did 
not matter to them (Quentin and Shreve) anyway, who 
could ■without moving, as free now of flesh as the father who 
decreed and forbade, the son who denied and repudiated, the 
lover who acquiesced, the beloved who was not bereaved, 
and •with no tedious transition firom hearth and garden to 
saddle, who could be already clattering over the frozen ruts 
of that December night and that C3iristmas dawn, that day 
of peace md cheer, of holly and goodwill and lo^ on the 
hcith; not two of them there and then either but four of 
t-bpm riding the two hotses throt^h the iron darkness, and 
fbat not matterii^ other: what fiices and what names they 
called themselves and were called by so long as the blood 
coursed — the blood, the immortal brief recent intransient 
blood which could hold honor above slothy unregret and 
love above fat and easy shame. 

“And Bon didn’t know it,” Shreve said, “The old man 
didn’t move and this time Henry didn t say You lie, he 
said ‘It’s not true’ and the old man said. ‘Ask him. Ask 
nbarlps then’ and then Henry knew that that was what his 
fetliw had meant all the time and that that was what he 
meant himself when he told his father he lied, because what 
the old man said wasn’t just ‘He is your brother’ but ‘Ifc 
has known all the time that he is yours and your sister’s 

295 



brother.’ But Bon didn’t know. Listen, dont you remember 
how your father said it, that not one time did he — tie old 
guy, the demon — ever seem to wonder how die other wife 
manned to find him, track him down, had never once 
seemed to wonder what she might have been doing all that 
time, the thirty years since that day when he paid his bill 
with her and got it receipted, so he thought, and saw with 
his own eyes that it was (so he thought) destroyed, tom up 
and throwm to the wind; never once wondered about this 
bat only that she had done it, could have and would have 
wanted to track him down? So it wasn’t her that told Bon. 
She wouldn’t have wanted to, maybe for the reason that she 
knew he — the demon — ^would believe she had. Or maybe 
she didn’t get around to telling him. Maybe she just never 
thought that there could be anyone as close to her as a lone 
diild out of her own body who would have to be told how 
she had been scorned and sufiered. Or maybe she was already 
telling it before he was big enough to know words and so 
by the time he was big enough to underetand what was be- 
ing told him she had told it so much and so hard that the 
words didn’t make sense to her anymore either because they 
didn’t have to make sense to her, and so she had got to the 
point where when she thought she was aying it she was 
quiet, and whoa she thought she was quiet h was just the 
hate and the fury and the unslcepicg and the unforgetting. 
Or maybe she didn’t intend for him to know it then. Maybe 
she was grooming him for that hour and moment which she 
oiuldn't foresee but that she knew would arrive some day 
because it would have to arrive or else she would have to do 
like the Aunt Rosa and deny that she had ever breathed— the 
moment when he (Bon) would stand side by side (not face 
'tofiice)whhhisfedierwhere^ecu:luckorjosticeorwhat- 
evacdtedafl^itounlddotherest (and it did, better than she 
20 



could have invented or hoped or even dreamed, and your 
fether said how bdng a woman she probably wasn’t even 
surprised) — grooming him herself, bringing him on by hand 
herself, washing and heding and puttmg him to bed and giv- 
ing him the candy and the toys and the other child’s fun and 
diversion and needs in measured doses like medicine with 
her own hand: not because she had to, w'ho could have hired 
a dozen or bought a hundred to do it for her widi the money, 
the jack that he (the de m on) had voluntarily surrendered, 
repudiated to balance his moral ledger: but like the million- 
aire who could have a hundred hostlers and handlers but who 
has just the one horse, the one maiden, the one moment, the 
one matching of heart and muscle and will with the one in- 
stant: and himsdf (the millionaire) patient in the overalls 
and the sweat and the stable muck, and the mother bringing 
him along to the moment when she would say ‘He is your 
&amp;ther. He cast you and me aside and denied you his name, 
Now go’ and then sit down and let God finish it: pistol or 
knife or rack; destruction or grief or ai^uish: God to call the 
shot or turn the whed. Jesus, you can almost see him: a Etde 
boy already come to kam, to expert, before he could re- 
member having learned his own name or the name of the 
town where he lived or how to say either of them, that every 
so often he would be snatched up from playing and held, 
gripped between the two hands fierce with (what passed at 
least with him for it) love, against the two fierce rigid knees, 
the face that he remembered since before remembering be- 
gan as supervising all the animal joys of palate and stomach 
and entrails, of warmth and pleasure and security, swoopirg 
down at him in a kmd of blazing immobility: he taking the 
interruption as a matter of course, as just another natural 
phenomaion of edstence; the face fihed with furious and al- 
most unbearable unfoi^ving almost like fover (not bitterness 

297 



and d^pair: just implacable will for revenge) as just an- 
odier manifestation of mammalian love — and be not know- 
ing what in hell it was all about. He would be too young to 
curry any connected fact out of the fury and hate and the 
tumbling speed; not comprehending or caring; just curious, 
creating for himself (without help since who to help him) 
his own notion of that Porto Bico or Haiti or wherever it 
was he understood vaguely that he had come firom, like 
orthodox childraa do of Heaven or the cabbage patch or 
wherever it was that they came from, except that his was 
different in that you were not supposed (your mother didn’t 
intend to, anyway) to ever go back there (and maybe when 
you got as old as she was you would be horrified too, every 
time you fennd hidden in your thov^hts anything that just 
smelled or tasted like it might be a wish to go back there). 
You were not supposed to know whai and why you left 
but only that you had escaped, that whatever power had 
created the place for you to hate it had likewise got you 
away from the place so you could hate it good and never for- 
^e it in quiet and mcmotony (though not exactly in what 
you would call peace); that you were to thank God you 
didn’t remembo: anything about it yet at the same time you 
were not t», maybe dared not to, ever forget it— he not even 
knowing maybe that he took it for granted that all kids 
didn’t have fethers too and that getting matched evary day 
cff so from whatever luumless puismt in which you were not 
bothering anybody or even thinking about them, by some- 
one because that someone was bigger than you, stronger than 
you, and being hdd for a minute or frve minutes under a 
kind ofbusted water pi^ of mcomptehenstble fury and fiatce 
yeaming and vindirtiveneK and jealous rage was p^ of 
chilc&amp;oc)d whi^h aH modim (ff (hildrm had recdved in turn 
frtm thdr mcdben and from thdr mothers in turn from tha^ 



Porto Rico or Haiti or wherever it was we all came from but 
none of us ever lived in. So that when he grew up and had 
children he would have to pass it on too (and maybe dcad- 
ing dien and there that it was too much trouble and bother 
and that he would not have any children or at least hoped he 
would not) and hence no man had a father, no one personal 
Porto Rko or Haiti, but all mother faces which ever bred 
swooping down at those almost calculable moments out of 
some obscure ancient general ajfrontmg and outragir^ which 
the actual living articulate meat had not even suffered but 
merely inherited; all boy flesh that walked and breathed 
stemming from that one ambiguous eluded dark fatherhead 
and so brothered perennial and ubiquitous everywhere under 
the sun ” 

Quentin and Shreve stared at one another — glared rather 
— their quiet regular breathing vaporiang faindy and steadily 
in the now tombhke air. Ihere was something curious in 
the way they looked at one another, curious and quiet and 
profoimdly intent, not at all as two young men might look 
at each other but alm ost as a youth and a very young 
might out of virginity itself— a sort of hushed and naked 
sparrhing, each look burdened with youth’s immemorial ob- 
session not with time’s dragging weight which the old live 
with but with its fluidity: the bright heels of all the lost 
moments of fifteen and sixteen. "Then he got older and got 
out from under the apron despite her (despite him too maybe; 
maybe the both of them) and he didn’t even care. He found 
out that she was up to something and he not only didn t 
care, he didn’t even care that he didn’t know what it was; 
he got older and found out that flie had been shying and 
tempering him to be the instr um e n t for whatever it was her 
hand was implacable for, maybe came to bdreve (or saw) 

(hat site had tricked him into receiving diat diape ai^ tempa, 

299 



and didn’t care about dut too boause probably by that time 
he had learned that there were three things and no more: 
breathing, pleasure, darkness; and without money there 
could be no pleasure, and without pleasure it would not even 
be breathing but mere protoplasmic inhale and collapse of 
blind unorganism in a darkness where light never began. 
And he had the money because he knew that she knew that 
the money was the only thing she could coerce and smooth 
him into the barrier with when Derby Day came, so die 
didn’t dare pinch him thore and she knew he knew it: so that 
maybe he even blackmailed her, bought her off that way: 
*you give me the jack as I want it and I wont ask why or 
what for yet.* Or maybe she was so busy grooming him that 
she never thought of the money now, who probably never 
had had much time to remember it or count it or wonder 
how much there was in the intervals of the hating and the 
being mad, and so all to check him up about the money 
would be the lawyer- He (Bon) probably learned that the 
first thing: that he could go to his modier and'hold the 
lawyer’s feet to the fire anytime, like the millionaire horse 
has only to come in one time with a littk extm sweat on bitn, 
and tomorrow he will have a new Jock. Sure, tiiat’s who it 
would be: the lawyer, that lawyer with his private mad fes- 
male rdllionaiie to ferm, who probably wasn’t interested 
enough in the money to see whether the (hecks had any 
other writing on them when she signed themr— that lawyer 
who, with Bon’s mother already plotting and planning 1 mm 
tince before he could remember for that day wheu he should 
he translated quick into so much rich and rotting dirt, had 
already been plowing and plantmg and harvesting him and 
the mother both as if he alrmdy was — that lawyer who mayi- 
be had the secret drawer in the secret safe and the secret paper 
in 14 htaybe a chart with oelored pins studk mto it like 



goierals have in campaigns, and all the notations in code: 
Today Sutpen finished robhittg a dmnken Indian of a hmtdred 
miles of virgin land, val. $zs,ooo. At 2:31 today cmne up out of

the contrary thinking stopping right still then, backing up a 
Ikde and spreading like when you lay a stick across a trickle 
of water, spreading and rising dow all arotaid him in what- 
ever place it was that he o^ald lock the door to and sk quiet 
and subtract the money that Bon was spending on his whores 
and his champagne firom what his mother had, and figure 
up how much would be left of it tomorrow and next month 
and next year or until Sutpen would be good and ripe- 
thinking about the good h^d cash that Bern was throwii^ 
away on his horses and clothes and the champagne and 
gambling and Women ^ would have known about the 
octoroon and die left -h an d ed marriage long hefom the 
mother did even if it had been any soxet; maybe he even had

might have a fence around U) and only him to try to check it, 
or as much as he dared, and not getting fcr because he knew 
too that all Bon had to do was to go to his mother and the 
race horse would have a gold eating troi^h if he wanted it 
and, if the jock wasn’t careful, a new jockey too — counting 
up the money, figuring what he would net at this normal 
rate over the next few years, and meanwhile crucified be- 
tween his two problems: whether maybe what he ought to 
do was to wash his hands of the Sutpen angle and clean up 
what was left and light out fi&gt;r Texas. Except that whenever 
he thought about doing that he would have to think about 
all the money that Bon had already spent, and that if he had 
only gone to Texas ten years ago or five years ago or even 
last year he would have made more: so that maybe at night 
while he would waiting for the window to begin to turn 

gray he would be like what Aunt Rosa said she was and he 
would have to deny that he breathed (or maybe wished he 
didn’t) except £or that two hundred percort. times the in- 
trinsic value every New Year’s— the water baddng up fibm 
the stick and rising and ^reading about him steady and quiet 
as l%hc and hitn sitting there in the actual white glare of 
dairvopnce (or second sight or fitidi in human misfertune 
and fofiy or whatever you want to call it) that was showing 
him not only what might happen but what was actually go- 
ing to happen and him declining to believe it was going to 
happen, not because it had come to him as a vision, bttt be- 
cause it would have to have love and honor and courage and 
pride in it; and believing it might happen, not because it was 
logical and possfele, but because it would be the most un- 
fortunatethingforallconcemedthatcouldoccor; and though 
you mold no mote have proved vice or virtue or monge or 
CQwaidim tohim vdlhicuit him the moving people 



than you could have proved death to him without showing 
him a corpse, he did beheve in misfortune because of that 
rigorous and arduous dusty eunuch’s training which taught 
to leave man s good luck and joys to God, vrho would in 
return surrender all liis miseries and follies and misfortunes 
to the lice and fleas of Coke and Litdetom And the old 
Sabine ” 

They stared — ^glared — at one another. It was Shreve speak- 
ing, though save for the slight diJEFerence wliich the inter- 
vening degrees of latitude had inculcated in them (differ- 
ences not in tone or pitch but of turns of phrase and usage 
of words), it might have been either of them and was in 
a sense both: both thinking as one, ,the voice which hap- 
pened to be speaking the thought only the thinking become 
audible, vocal; the two of them creating between them, out 
of the rag-tag and bob-ends of old tales and talking, people 
who perhaps had never existed at all anywhere, who, shad- 
ows, were shadows not of flesh and blood which had lived 
and died but shadows in turn of what were (to one of them 
at least, to Shreve) shades too, quiet as the visible murmur of 
their vaporizing breath. The chimes now began to ring for 
midnight, melodious, slow and faint beyond the closed, the 

snow-sealed, window. “ the old Sabine, who couldn’t 

to save her life have told you or the lawyer or Bon or any- 
body else probably what she wanted, expected, hoped for 
because she was a woman and didn’t need to want or hope or 
expect anything, but just to want and expect and hope (and 
besides, your father said that when you have plenty of good 
strong hating you dont need hope because the hating will be 
enough to nourish you) — ^the old Sabine (not so old yet, but 
she would have just let herself go in the sense that you keep 
the engines clean and oiled and the best of coal in the btmkers 
but you dont bother to shine the brightwork or holystone 

303 



the decks aaymote; just let herself go on the outside. Not 
fet; db.e would bum it up too fast for that, shrivel it away in 
the gullet between swallowing and stomach; no pleasure in 
the chewing; having to chew just another nuisance like no 
pleasure in the clothing; having the old wear out and having 
to choose the new just another nuisance: and no pleasure in 

the iSne figure he " neither of them said ‘Bon’ “ cut 

in the fine pants that fit his leg and the fine coats that fit his 
shoulders nor in the fact that he had more watches and cuff 
buttons and finer linen and horses and ydlow-vdweled bug- 
gies (not to mention the gals) than most others did, but all 
that too just an unavoidable nuisance that he would have to 
g^ s hut of before he could do her any good just like he had 
to get shut of the teething and die chicken pox and the light 
boy’s bones in order to be able to do her any good) — the old 
Sabine getting the faked reports from the lawyer like reports 
tout back to headquarters from a batde firont, with maybe a 
spedal nigger in the lawyer’s anteroom to do nothing else 
but carry diem and that maybe once in two years or five 
times in two days, depending on when she would begin to 
itch for news and began to worry him — the report, (he com- 
munique about how we are not far behind him (Sutpen) in 
Texas or Missouri or maybe California (Califiamia would be 
fine, that 6r away; convenient, proof inherent in the sheer 
distance, the necessity to acc^t and believe) and we are go- 
ing to catch up widi him any day now and so do not worry. 
So she woul^\ she wouldn’t worry at all: she would just 
have out the carriage and go to the lawyer, busting in in the 
black dress that looked like a secrion of limp stove pipe and 
maybe not even a hat but just a shawl ot^ ho: head, so that 
the only things mfeing would he the mop and the pail— 
busdng m and saying ‘He’s dead. I know he is dead and how 
can he, how can he he,* not meaning what the Aunt Rosa 



meaat: wtme did they find or iment a bullet that could kill him 
but How cfl» he he allowed to die wititout hainng to admit diat 
he was wrong and suffer and regret it. And so in tbe nejct two 
seconds they would almost catcb him (he^-the lawyer — 
would show her (he actual letter, the writing in the T?nglKh 
she couldn’t read, that had just come in, that he had just srait 
for the nigger to carry to her when she came in, and the 
lawyer done practised putting dhe neceisary date on the letter 
until he could do it now whik hh bade would be toward her, 
in the two seconds it would take him to get the letter out of 
the file) — catch him, get so close to him as to have ample 
satisfaction tihat he was alive; so close indeed that he would 
be able to get her out of the office before she had sat down 
and into the carriage again and on die way home a gain 
where, among (he Horcaiane mirrors and Paris drapes and 
tufted camisoles, she would stili look like die one (hat had 
come in to scrub the floors, in the black dress that die cook 
wouldn’t have looked at even when it was new five or she 
years ago, holding, dutching the letter she couldn’t read 
(maybe the only word in it she could even recognize would 
be (he word ‘Sutpen’) in one hand and brushing back a rope 
of lank iron-colored hair with the other and not looldbg at 
the letter like she was leadbigit even if die could have, but 
swooping at it; blazing down at it as if she knew she would 
have only a second to read it in, only a second for it to re- 
main intact in after her eyes would touch it; before it took 
fixe and so wouM not be pemsed but consumed, leaving her 
lifting there with a black crumbling blank carbon ash in iter 
hand.

again when he came to the point where his carcass quit bdng 
a baby and became a boy, new again when he quit being a

woman whom he had thought was feeding and washing and 
putting him to bed and findmg him in the extra dddings for 
his palate and his pleasure because he was himself, until he 
got big enough to find out that it wasn’t him at all she was 
wadiing and feeding the candy and the fun to but it was a 
man diat hadn’t even arrived yet, whom even she had never 
seen yet, who would be something else beside that boy when 
he did arrive like the dynamite which destroys the house and 
the femiiy and maybe even the whole community aint the 
old peacefiil paper that maybe would rather be blo'wing aim- 
less and light along the wind or the old merry sawdust or the 
old quiet chemicals that had rather be still and dark in the 
quiet earth like they had been before the meddling guy with 
ten-power spectacles came and dug them up and strained, 
warped and kneaded them — created between this woman 
and a hired lawyer (the woman who since befe»re he could 
remember he now realized had been planning and grooming 
him fe»r some moment that would come and pass and fellow-

“So he went away. He went away to school at the age of 
twenty-eight. And he wouldn’t know nor care about that 
either: which of them — ^mother or lawj'er — ^it was who de- 
cided he should go to school nor why, because he had known 
all the time that his mother was up to somethmg and that 
the lawyer was up to something, and he didn’t care enough 
about what either of them was to try to find out, who knew 
that the lawyer knew that his mother was up to something 
but that his mother didn’t know that the lawyer was up to 
something, and that it would be all right with the lawyer if 
his mother got whatever it was she wanted, provided he (the 
lawyer) got what he wanted one second before or at least 
at the same time, Hfe went away to school; he said ‘All right’ 
and told the octoroon goodbye and went to school, who not 
in all the twenty-eight years had ever been told by anyone, 
‘Do as these others do; have this task done at nine sum. to- 
morrow or Friday or Monday*; maybe it was even the oc- 
toroon whom they (or the lawyer) used— the light block 
(not tether) which the lawyer had put on him to keep him 
&amp;om getting inside of somethh^ which might be found to 
have a fence around it later. Maybe the mother found out 
about the octoroon and the child and the ceremony and dis- 
covered more than the lawyer had (or would believe, who 
considered Bon only dull, not a fool) and sent for him and 
he came and lounged against the mantel again and maybe 
knowing what was up, what had happened before she told

call smiling except it was not that but just something you 
couldn’t see through or past, and she watching him with

{eax, but ^ manning to keep it doxvii since she could not 
talk about betrayal because she had not told him yet, and 
now, at this moment, she would not dare risk it— he looking 
s£ her &amp;om behind the smiling that wasn’t smiling but was 
just something you were not supposed to see beyond, saying, 
admitting it: ‘\it^y not? All young men do it The ceremony 
too, I didn’t set out to get the duld, but now that I have. . . . 
It’s iKJt a bad child, either’ and she watching him, glaring at 
him and not being able to say what she would because she 
had put oiF too long now saying what she could: ‘But you. 
This is difierent’ and he (she would not need to say it He 
would know because he already knew why she had sent for 
him, even if he did not know and did not care what she had 
been up to since before he could remember, since before he 
could take a woman whether in love or not): ‘Why not? 
Men seem to have to marry some day, sooner or later. And 
this is one whom 1 know, who makes me no trouble. And 
with the ceremony, that bother, already done. And as for a 

littk matter like a spot of negro blood ” not n^ding to 

talk much, say much either, not needing to say I seem to have 
beeti horn into this world with so few fathers that I have too many 
breviers to ottifage and shame while alive and hence too many de- 
scendants to bequeath my Utde portion ofhmt and ham to, dead; 

not that, just ‘a little spot of negro blood and then to 

watch the face, the desperate urgency and fear, then to de- 
part, kissittg her maybe, her hand maybe whicht would lie in 
his and even touch hh lips Hke a dead hand because of the 
desperate casting for this straw or that; maybe as he wait

be ehk is hmo—f I cored to htm. J^ybe by night he did, 
wybe befote thiU; if they managed to find him, ^ word to 
hum, hecanse she went to the lawyer. And it was ri^ in the 



lawyer’ s alley. Maybe before she even got started telling it 
good that gentle white glow began like when you turn up 
a wick; maybe he could even almost see his hand writing 
on into the space where the daughter? daughter? daughter? 
never had quite showed. Because maybe that had been the 
lawyer’s trouble and worry and concern all the time; that 
ever since she had made lin promise he would never tell 
Bon who his father was, he had been waiting and wondering 
how to do it, since maybe he knew that if he were to tell 
Bon, Bon might believe it or he might not, but certainly he 
would go and tell his mother that the lawyer had told him 
and then he (the lawyer) would be sunk, not for any harm 
done because there would be no harm, since this could not 
alter tie situation, but for having crossed his paranoiac 
dient Maybe while he would sit in his office addir^ and sub- 
tractit^ the money and addmg what they would get out of 
Sutpen ^ was never worried about what Bon would do 
when he found out; he had probably a long rime ago paid 
Bon that compliment of thinking that even if he was too dull 
or too indolent tx&gt; suspect or find out about his ffither him- 
self, he wasn’t fool enough not to be able to take advant^ 
of it once somebody showed him the proper move; maybe 
if the thougiht had ever occurred to him dat because of love 
or honor or anything else under Heaven or jurisprudence 
either. Bon would not, would refuse to, he (the lawyer) 
would even have furnished proof that he no loiter breathed) 
— ^maybe all the time it was this that tacked him: how to get 
Bon where he would either have to find it out h i m .se lf , or 
wh^ somebody — the &amp;her or the motiier — would have 
totdlhim. Somaybeslw wasn’t out of the office good— or 
at feast as soon as he had had rinae to open the safe and look 
m the Kcret drawer and make sure that it was the Ooiveraty 

that Henry attended— befiare has hand was 



•writing steady and even into the space where the daughter? 
daughter? daughter? never had showed — ^and "Brith the date 
here too: iS5p. Two children. Say i860, 20 years. Increase 200%

sible No. Incest threat: Credible Yes and the hand going back 
fefore it put do’wn the period, lining out the Credible, writ- 
ing in Certain, underlining it. 

“And he didn’t care about that too; he just said, ‘All right.* 
Because maybe he knew now that his modier didn’t know 
and never would know what she wanted, and so he couldn’t 
beat her (maybe he had learned from the octoroon that you 
cant beat women anyhow and tbat if you are wise or dislike 
trouble and uproar you dont even try to), and he knew that 
all the lawyer wanted was just the money; and so if he just 
didn’t make the mistake of believing tbat he could beat all 
of it, if he just remembered to be quiet and be alert he could 
beat some of it. — So he said, ‘All right’ and let his mother 
pack the fine clothes and the fine linen into the bags and 
trunks, and maybe he lounged into the lawyer’s office and 
watched from h^iind that something which could have been 
called smiling while the lawyer made the elbow motion 
about getting his horses onto the steamboat and maybe buy- 
ing him an extra special body servant and arran^g about 
the money and all; watching from behind the smiling while 
the lawyer did the heavy father even, talking about the 
Kholarship, the culture, the Latin and the Greek that would 
equip and polish him for the position which he would hold 
in life ^d how a man to be sure could get that anywhere, in 
his own library even, who had the will; but how there was 
sacn^ung, some quality to culture which only the monastic, 
the doi^al monotony of a— say obscure and small (though 

hi^ c!as?5, highclMs) ccdli^— and he (aedther of them

said ‘Bon.’ Neva: at any time did there seem to be any con- 
fusion between them as to whom Shreve meant by ‘he’) 

“ listening courteous and quiet behind that expression 

which you were not supposed to see past, asidng at last, in- 
terrupting maybe, courteous and affable — ^nothing of irony,, 
nothing of sarcasm — ^“What did you say this college wase’: 
and now a good deal of elbow motion here while the lawyer 
would shuffle through the papers to find the one fi-om which 
he could read that name which he had been memorizing 
ever since he first talked to the mother: ‘The University of 
Mississippi, at’ — -Where did you say?” 

“Oxford,” Quentin said. “It’s about forty miles from ** 

“ ‘Oxford.’ And then the papers could be still again 

because he would be talking; about a small college only ten 
years old, about how there wouldn’t be anything to distract 
him from his studies there (where, in a sense, wisdom herself 
would be a virgin or at least not very second hand) and how 
he would have a chance to olserve another and a provincial 
section of the country in which his high destiny was rooted;

iTriTninent, the successful conclusion of which we all hoped 
for, had no doubt of) as the man he would be and the eco- 
nomic power he would represent when his mother passed 
on, and he listening behind that escpression, saying, ‘Then 
you dont recommend the law as a vocation!’ and now for 
just a moment the lawyer would stop, but not long; maybe 
not long enough or perceptible enough for you to call it 
pause: and he would be looking at Bon too: ‘It hadn’t oc- 
curred to me that the law m%ht appeal to you’ and Bon: 
‘Neither did practising with a rapier appeal to me while I 
was doing it. But I can retail at least one occasion in my life 
when I was glad I had’ and then the lawyer, smooth and 
easy: ‘Then by all m^ms let it be the law. Y^our mother wifi

ag— be pleased’ ‘All right,’ he said, not ‘goodbye’; he didn’t 
care. Maybe he didn’t even say goodbye to the octoroon, to 
those tears and lamentations and maybe even the dinging, 
the soft despairing m^^iolia-colored arms about his Imees, 
and (say) three and a half feet above dose boneless steel 
gyves that expression of his which was not s miling but just 
something not to be seen through. Because you cant beat 
them: you just flee (and thank God you can flee, can «cape 
firom that massy five-foot-thick maggot-cheesy solidarity 
which overlays the earth, in which men and women in cou- 
ples ate ranked and racked like ninepins; dxanks to whatever 
Gods for that masculine hipless tapering peg which fits light 
and glib to move where the cartridgfr&lt;hambered hips of 
women hold them fast) — ^not goodbye: all right: and one 
night he walked up the gangplank between de torches and 
probably only de lawyer dcre to see him off and this not 
for god^eed but to m^e sure that he actually took de boat. 
And de new extra nigger opening de bags in de stateroom, 
spreadit^ de fine dodes, and de ladies dready gadered in

watching de city drift and wink and glitter and sink away 
and den all motion cease, de boat suspended immobile and 
widout progress from de stars themselves by de two ropes 
of ^ark-fillcd smoke streaming upward from the stacks. 
And who knows what thinking, what sober weighing and 
discarding, who had known for years that his moder was 
up to something; that the lawyer was up to something and 
dot^h he knew that wasjust money, yet he knew that within 
Im (^ lawyer’s) known masculine limitations he (de law- 
yer) could te almost as dangerous as de unknown quan-

particular collie, whidt he had never heard of, which tea 
years j^o did not even adst; and knowing too that it was 
the lawyer who had chosen it for him— what sober, whas 
intent, what almost frowning Why? Why? Why 0iis coltege, 
this particular one above all others ? — ^maybe leaning th«e in 
that solitude between panting smoke and et^h^^ and almost 
touching the answer, aware of the jigsaw puzzle picture 
tegers of it waiting, almost lurking, just beyond his reach, 
inextricable, jumbled, and unrecognizable yet on the point 
of failing into pattern which would reveal to him at once, 
like a flash of light, the meaning of his whole life, past — the 
Haiti, the chilc^iood, the lawyer, the woman who was his 
mother. And maybe the letter itself right there trader lus 
feet, somewhere in the darkness beneath the dedk on which 
he stood— the letter addressed not to Thomas Sutpen at Sut- 
pen’s Hundred but to Hfenry Sutpen, Esquire, in Readeace 
at the UnivCTsity of Mississippi, near Oxford, MissssippL 
One day Heruy showed it to him and there was no gentle 
^(reading glow but a flash, a glare (showed it to him who not 
only had no visible fether but had found himself to be, even 
in infancy, endosed by an unsleeping cabal bait apparently 
on teadiing him that he had never had a fether, that his mo- 
ther had emerged from a sojourn in limbo, from that state 
of blessed amnesia in which the weak senses can take refuge 
from the godless dark force and powers which weak human 
flcfli cannot stand, to wake pc^;nant, shriekiug and scream- 
ing and thrashing , not against the ruthless agony of labor 
but itt protest against the outrage of her swelling loins; that 
he had been fethered on her not through that natural process 
but had been blotted onto and out of her body by the old 
infernal immortal male pricKiple of att unbridled terror and 
darkness) a glare in which he stood looking a£ the innocent 
face of t^ youth almost ten years his junior, vdtfle one part

"The letter whidi he — ” it was not Bon Shreve meant now, 
yet agam Qnoitin seemed to comprehend without difficulty 
or efibrt whom he meant " — ^wrote maybe as soon as he 
finished that last entry in the record, into the daughter? daugh-

ter— ^ot remembering anything about young love from his 
own youth and would not have bcUeved it if he had, yet 
willing to use that too as he would have used courage and 
pride, thinking not of any hushed wild importunate blood 
and light hands hungry for touching, but of the fiict thar this 
Oxford and this Sufpen’s Hundred were only a day’s ride 
.i^tatt and Henry already established in the University and so 
maybe for once in his hfo the lawyer even believed in God: 
My Dear Mr S^pen: The undersigned name will not be known 
to you, nor are the writer' s position and circumstances, for all their 
r^eckd wordt and {I hope) pJue, so ttnobscure as to warrant the 
hope diat he will euer see you in person or you he — worth reflected 
from tttd value rendered to two persons ofhirdi and position, one of 
whom, a lady and widowed mother, resides in that sechmon befit- 
her condition in the city fiom which this letter is inscribed, die 
other of whom, a young gentleman her son, will either be as you 
read this, or will shordy thererfer be a petitioner before the same 
Bar of knowledge and wisdom as yourself. Jt is in his behalf duU 
I write. No: I unit not say behalf; certainly X diall not let his lady 
nwthet nor the. young gentleman himself suspect that I used duU 
term, even to one, Sir, scion of the prindpd family of that county 
as it is your fortuned lot to be. hde^, it were better for me if I 
md mitten at aU, jB«f l itr; X have; it is krevocabk now; if you 



4ixem aught in thb letter which smacks af humility, take it as 
coming not fiom the mother and certainly not from the son, but 
from the pen of one whose humble position as legal adviser and man 
of business to the above described lady and young getulemm, whose 
loyalty and latitude toward one whose generosity has found him 
(I not corfess this; I proclaim it) in bread and meat and fire and 

shelter over a period long enough to have taught him gratitude and 
loydty even if he had not known them, has led him into an acHon 
whose means fall behind its irUention for the reason that he is only 
what he is and professes himself to be, not what he would. So take 
Ais, Sir, neither as the unwarranted insolence which an unsolicited 
communication fiom myself to you would be, not as a plea for suf- 
ferance on behalf of an unknown, but as an iiWroduction {clumsy 
though it he) to one yout^ gentleman whox position needs ndther

another young gentleman'whoSe poMon regdres neidcer detailing 
nor recapitulation in the place where it was written . — ^Not good-

love nor pride to receive or inBict, neither honor not diame

other, like to a cat — cosmopolitan New Orleans or bucolic 
Mississippi: his own inherited and Ireritable Fbrenrine lamps 
and gil^d toilet seats and tufted mirrors, or a little jerkwater 
college not ten years old; champagne in the octoroon’s bou- 
doir or whiskey on a harsh new table in a monk’s cell and a 
&lt;x&gt;untry youth, a bucolic heir apparent who had probably 
never spent a dozen nights outside of his paternal house (un- 
less perhaps to lie fiilly dressed beside a fire in the woods 
li^rening to dogs running) until he came to school, whom 1» 
watched aping his dothing carriage ^eech and aU and (die 
youth) completdy unaware that he was doing it, who (the 
youth) over die botde one night said, blurted— no, not 
Uurted; it would be fiimbling, g?x^ing: asA he (the cosmo-

polite tea yean the youth’s senior almost, lounging in one 
of the silk robes the like of whkh the youth had never seen 
before and believed that only women wore) watching the 
youth blush fiery red yet stili fke him, still look him straight 
m the eye while he fumbled, groped, blurted with abrupt 
complete irrelevance: ‘If I had a brother, I wouldn’t want 
him to be a younger brother’ and he: ‘Ah?’ and die youth: 
‘No. I would want him to be older than me’ and he: ‘No son 
of a landed father wants an older brother and the youth: 
‘Yes. I do’, looking straight at the other, the esoteric, the 
sybarite, stanchng (the youth) now, erect, thin (because he 
was young), his face scarlet but his head iigh and his eyes 
steady: ‘Yes. And I would want him to be just like you’ and 
he: ‘b that so? The whiskey’s your side. Drink or pass.* 
“And now,” Shreve said, “we’re going to talk about 
love.” But he didn’t need to say that either, any more than 
he had needed to specify which he meant by he, since neither 
of them had been thinking about anything else; all that had 
gone before just so much that had to be overpassed and none 
else present to overpass it but them, as someone always has 
to rie the leaves up before you can have the bonfire. That 
was why it did not matter to dither of them which one did 
the talking, since it was not the talking alone which did it, 
performed and accomplished the overpassing, hut some 
happy marriage of speaking and hearing wherein each before 
the demand, the requirement, forgave condoned and forgot 
the faulting of the other— fiiuidngs both in the creating of 
this shade whom they discussed (raher, existed in) and in 
hearing and sifHng and discarding he filse and con^rving 
what seemed true, or fit the preconcdved—in order to over- 
pass tolove, where here might be paradox and inconasteacy 
but nothing fault nor fihe. “And now, love. He must haw?

same source that mine did, but which sprang in quiet peace and con~ 
tentmefit and ran in steady even though monotonous sunlight, 
where that which he bequeathed me sprang in hatred and outrage 
and unforgiving and ran in shadow — what could I not mold of this 
malleSle and eager clay which that father himself could not — to 
what shape of what good there might, must, he in that blood and 
none handy to take and mold that portion of it in until too late: 
or what moments when he might have toH himself that it 
was nonsense, it could not be true; lhat such coincidenas 
only happened in hooks, thinking — the wariness, the fatal- 
ism, the incorrigible cat for solitude — That young clodhopper 
bastard. How shdl I get rid of him: and then the voice, the other

hopper bastard) and die days, the afternoons, while they rode 
togethor (and Henry aping him here too, who vm the better 
hmseman, who maybe had nothing of what Bon would 
have called style but who had done more of it, to whom a 
hors was as natural as walking, vdio would ride anything 
anywhere and at anything) while he must have watched 
himself being swamped and submerged in the bright unreal 
flood of Henry’s speah, translated (the three of them: him- 
self and Henry and the sister whom he had never seen and 
perhaps did not even have any curiceity to see) into a wodd 
like a fliiry tale in which nothing else save them existed, rid- 
ing beside Henry, listening, needing to ask no questions, to 
prompt to farther sporeh in any manner that youth who did 
not evm suspect that he and the man beside him might be 
brothers, who each time his breath aossed his vocal chords 
was saying From now on mine and my sister" s house will he ysm 
house mine emd my sister" s lives your life, wondering (Bon) 
— or maybe not wondering at all— how if conditioas were 
reversed and I&amp;nry was die strango: and he ^Bon) die scum 
and sdS kniew whfut he suspected, if he would say the same; 



thm (Bon) agimng at last, saying at last, ‘All right I’ll come 
home with yon for Christmas,’ not to see the third inhabitant 
ofHenry’s &amp;iry tale, not to see the sister because he had not 
oni£ thought of her: he had merely listened about her: but 
tbminng So at last I shall see him, whom it seems I was bred up 
never to expect to see, whom I had even learned to live withmt, 
thinking maybe how he would walk into the house and see 
the man who made him and then he would know; them 
would be that flash, that instant of indisputable recognition 
Ictween them and he would know for sore and forever — 
thijoking maybe That’s dl I want He need not even acknowledge

the saying of it— the physical touch even thougji in sanet, 
hidden — ^the living touch of that fledi warmed b^orc he was 
bom by the same blood which it had b^ueadied him to 
warm his own flesh with, to be bequeathed by him in tom 
to run hot and loud in veins and limbs after that first flesh 
and then his own were dead. So the Christmas came and he 
and Henry rode the forty mfles to Sutpen’s Hundred, with 
Henry stiU talking, sail keeping distended and light and iri- 
descent with steady breathing that fairy balloon-vacuum in 
which the three of them existed, lived, moved even maybe, 
in without flefli — ^faunself and the fiiend and the 

sister whom the fiiend had never seen and (though Henry 
did not know it) bad not even thought about yet but only 
Kstened about firom behind the more urgent thinking , and 

3t9 



Henry probably not even noaeing that the nearer they came 
to home the less Bon talked, had to say on any subjea, and 
maybe even (and certainly Henry would not know this) 
listening less. And so he wait into the house: and maybe 
somebody looking at him would have seen on his &amp;ce an 
expression a good deal like the one — ^that proflfeting with 
humility yet with pride too, of complete surrender — ^which 
he had used to see on Henry’s fece, and maybe he telling him- 
self I noi mly dont know what it is I want but apparently lama 
good deal younger than I thought also: and saw face to face die 
man who might be his father, and nothmg happened — ^no 
shock, no hot communicated flesh that speech would have 
beai too slow even to impe^ — nothing. And he spent ten 
days there, not only the esoteric, the sybarite, the steel blade 
in the silken tessellated sheath which Henry had begun to ape 
at the Univershy, but the object of art, the mold and mirror 
of form and fo^on whidi 1^ Sutpen (so your father said) 
accepted him as and insisted (didn’t your father say?) that 
Ite 1» (and would have purchased him as and paid for him 
with Judith even, if there had beoi no other bidder amcmg 
the four of them — or didn’t your father say?) and which he 
did lanain to hoc until he disappeared, taking Henry with 
him, and she never saw him again and war and trouble and 
grief and bad food filled her days until maybe she didn’t even 
ronember after a while that she had ever forgot him. (And 
the girl, the aster, the virgin— Jesus, who to know what she 
siw that afietnoon when they rode up the drive, what 
prayer, what maidai meditative dream ridden up out of 
whatever febuious land, not in harsh stove iron but die silken 
and tragic Inncdot nearing thirty, ten years older than she 
was and wearied, sated wifo what expaiences and pleasures, 
which Hairy* s letters must have created for her.) And the 
day came to tfepate and no s^ yet; he and Henry rotfe away 



and still no sign, no more sign at parting than when he hsd 
seen it first, in that fac« where he might (he would believe) 
have seal for himself the truth and so would have needed no 
sign, if it hadn’t been for the beard; no sign in the eyes which 
could see his &amp;ce because there was no beard to hide it, could 
have seen the truth if it were there: yet no flicker in rhem; 
and so he knew it was in his fare because he knew that the 
other had seen it thae just exactly as Henry was to know the 
next Christmas eve m the library that his father was not lying 
by the fact that the father said nothing, did nothing. Maybe 
he even thought, wondered if perhaps that was not why the 
beard, if maybe the other had not hidden behind that beard 
agdnst this very day, and if so, why? why? thinking But 
why? Why? since he wanted so little, could have undentood 
if the other had wanted the sig^ to be in secret, would have 
been quick and glad to let it be in secret even if he could not 
have understood why, thinking in the middle of this My 
God, 1 am young, young, &lt;md I didnt even hnow it; they didn’t 
even tdl me, that I was young, frehng that same dapair and 
shame like when you have to watch your father feil in phys- 
ical course, thinking. It dtould have been me that faikd; me, I, 
not he who stemmed fiom that btood whkJi we both bear before it 
could have become exmupt md tainted by whatever it was in woffe- 
er’s that he could not brook. — •Wait,” Shieve erkd, hough 
Quentin had not spoken: it had been merely some qoaKty, 
some gathering of Quentin’s still laxed and hunched figure 
which presaged speech, breause Shreve said Wait. Wait, be- 
fore Quentin couM have begun to speak. “Because he hadn’t 
even looked her. Oh, he had sren her all ri^t, he had had 
plenty of opportunity for that; he could not have helped but 
that because Mrs Sutpen would have seen to it — ten days df 
that kind of planned and arranged and exeemtod pavada 
like the campa%ps d dead genorals in he texhodb, in H- 



braries and parlors and drives in the buggy in the afternoons 
—all planned three months ago when Mrs Sutpen read 
Henry’s first letter with Son’s name in it, until maybe even 
Judith too began to feel hke the other one to a pair of gold- 
fish: and him even talking to her too, or what talking he 
could have found to do to a country girl who probably 
never saw a man young or old before who sooner or later 
didn’t smell like manure; talking to her about like he would 
talk to the old dame on the gold chairs in the parlor, except 
that in the one case he would have to make all the conversa- 
tion and in the other he would not even be able to make his 
own escape but would have to wait for Henry to come and 
get him. And maybe he had even thought about her by that 
time; maybe at the times when he would be telling himself 
it amt be so; he could not look at me like this every day and make 
no sign if it were so he would even tell himself She would be 
easy like when you have left the champagne on the supper 
table and are walking toward the whiskey on the sideboard 
and you happen to pass a cup of lemon sherbet on a tray and 
you look at the sherbet and tell yourself. That would be easy 
too only who wants it. — ^Does that suit you?” 

“But it’s not love,” Quentin said. 

“Because why not? Because listen. What was it the old 
dame, the Aunt Rosa, told you about how there are some 
things that just have to be whether they are or not, have to 
be a damn, sight more than some other things that maybe 
are and it dont matter a damn whether they ate or not? That 
was it. He just didn’t have time yet. Jesus, he must have 
known it would be. Like that lawyer drought, he wasn’t a 
fool; the trouble was, he w^’ t the kind of not-fool the law- 
yer thoi^ht he would be. He must have known it was going 
to happen. It would be like you passed that sherbet and may- 
be you knew you would even teach the adeboard and 



whiskey, yet you knew that tomoirow morning you would 
want that sherbet, dien you reached the whi^ey and you 
knew you wanted that sherbet now; maybe you didn’t even 
go to the sideboard, maybe you even looked back at hat 
champagne on the supper table among the dirty haviland 
and the crumpled damask, and all of a sudden you knew you 
didn’t want to go back there even. It would be no question 
of choosing, having to choose between the champagne or 
whiskey and the sherbet, but all of a suhkn (it would be 
spring then, in that country where he had never spent a 
spring before and you said North Mississippi is a little harder 
country than Louisiana, with dogwood and violets and he 
early scentless flowers but the earh and the nights still a little 
cold and the hard tight sticky buds like young girls’ nipples 
on alder and Judas trees and beech and maq?le and even some- 
tbing young in the cedars like he never aw be&amp;re) you find 
that you dont want anything but that sherbet and that you 
haven’t been wanting anytfakg dse but that and you have 
been wanting that pretty hard for some time — besides know- 
ing that that sherbi is there for you to take. Not jurt for any- 
body to take but for you to take, knowing just from looking 
at that cup that it would be like a flowff that, if any other 
hanA reached for it, it would have thorns On it but not for 
your hand; and him not used to that smee all the other cups 
fhat had boon willing and easy for him to take up hadn’t otm- 
tained dierbet but champa^e or at hast kitchen wine. And 
more than that. There was the knowing what he suspected 
m%ht be so, or not knowing if it was so or not. And who to 
say if it wasn’ t maybe the po^bflity of incest, because vho 
(without a aster: I dont know about the others) has been in 
love and not discovered the vain evanescence of the fleshly 
eiutounter; vdho hasnothad to realize that when the brief all 
is done you must retreat firmn both love and pleasure, gad»x 



op your otm rubbish and refo^ — ^the hats and pants and 
shoes which you drag through the world — ^and retreat since 
the gods condone and practise the^ and the dreamy im- 
measurabk coupling which floats obKvious above the tram- 
eling and hanied instant, the: was-not: is: was: is a perquisite 
only of balloony and weighdess elephants and whales: but 
maybe if there were sin too maybe you would not be per- 
mitted to escape, uncouple, return. — ^Aint that rightt” He 
ceased, he could have been interrupted easily now. Quentin 
could have spoke now, but Quentin did not. He just sat as 
before, his hands in his trousers pcxiets, his shoulders hugged 
mward and hunched, his face lowered and he looking some- 
how curiously smaller than he actually was because of his 
actual height and spareness — that quality of delicacy about 
the bones, articulation, which even at twaity still had some- 
thing about it, some last echo about it, of adolescence — that 
is, as compared widi the cherubic burliness of the odier who 
Bxxi him, who looked younger, whose very superiority in 
bulk and displacement made him look evm younger, as a 
plump boy of twelve who outwe%hs the other by twenty 
or thkty pounds still looks younger dian the boy of fourteen 
who had that plumpness cmce and lost it, sold it (whether 
with his consent or not) f&gt;r that state of vir^nity which is 
neither boy’s nor girl’s. 

“I dont know,” Quentin said. 

“All rigltt,” Shreve saicL "Maybe I dont either. Only, 
Jkus, some day you are bound to fell in love They just 
wouldn’t beat you that way. It would be like if God htid gO|t 
Jesus bom and saw that he had the carpenter tools and then 
nevex gave him anythii^ to build with djem. Dont you be- 
hwethats” 

"I dont know,” Qtantin said. Hfe did not mow^ Sireve 
Jodb^ at Km. Even while they mre.not talking these 



breatlis in the tomblike air vapori^d gently and quietly. Tbe 
chimes for midnight would have rung some time ago now. 

“You mean, it dont matter to you?” Quentin did not an- 
swer. “That’s right Dont say it. Becatise I would know you 
are lyii^. — ^All right then. Listen. Because he never had to 
worry about the love because that would take care of itself 
Maybe he knew there was a fate, a doom on him, hke what 
(he old Aunt Rosa told you about some things that just have 
to be whether (hey are or not, just to balance the books, 
write Paid on the old sheet so that whoever keeps them can 
tai» it out of the ledger and bum it, get rid of it Maybe he 
knew (hot that whatever the old man had done, whether he 
meant well or ill by it, it wasn’t going to be the old man 
who would have to pay the check; and now that the old man 
was bankrupt with the mcompetmce of age, who should do 
the paying ^ not his sons, his get, because wasn’t it dcme that 
way in the old days; the old Abraham &amp;11 of years atul weak 
and incapable now of further harm, caught |t last and the 
captains and the collectots saying, ’Old man, we dont want 
you’ and Abraham would say, ‘Praise the Lord, 1 have raised 
about me sons to bear the burden of mine iniquities and per- 
secutions; yea, perhaps even to restore my Bocks and herds 
from the hand of the ravisher: that I m%ht rest mine eyes 
upon my goods and chattels, upon die generaricms of them 
and of my dscendants Increased an hundred fold as my soul 
goeth out from me.’ He knew all the time that the low 
wDidd take cate of itself. Maybe that was why he didn’t have 
to think about her during those three months between that 
September and that Christmas while Henry talked ahom her 
to him, saying every time he breathed: jEfers and mf Ihes me 
to exist widm and upon yours; did not need to waste any time 
ova: the love after it happened, backfired on him, why he 
never b&lt;«hered to wrke ha any letters (esccept that last one) 

325 



whidi she would want to save, why he never actually pro- 
posed to Iter and gave her a ring for Mrs Sutpen to show 
around. Because the fate was on her too: the same old Abra- 
ham who was so old and weak now nobody would want 
him in the flesh on any debt; maybe he didn’t even have to 
wait for that Christmas to see her to know tins; maybe that’s 
what it was that came out of the three months of Henry’s 
talking that he heard without listening to: I am not hearing 
ehotti a young girl, a virgin; I am hearing about a narrow delicate 
fenced virgin field already furrowed and bedded so that all I shall 
need to do is drop the seeds in, caress it smooth again, saw her that 
Christmas and knew it for certain and then forgot it, went 
back to school and did not even remember that he had for- 
gotten it, because he did not have time then; maybe it was 
just one day in that spring you told about when he stopped 
and said, right quiet: All righL I want to go to bed with who 
might be my sister. All right and then forgot that too. Because 
he didn’t have time. That is, he didn’t have anything else but 
time, b^ause he had to wait. But not for her. That was all 
fixed. It was the other. Maybe he thought it would be in the 
mail bag each time the nigger rode over from Sutpen’s Hun- 
dred, and Henry bdieving it was the letter &amp;om her that he 
was waidng for, when what he was tfainkh^ was Maybe he 
will write it then. He would Just have to write T am your father, 
Btm this’ and I would do it. Or if not that, a sheet, a scrap of paper 
with the one word ‘Charles’ in his hand, and I would hum what 
he meant and he would not even have to ask me to bum it. Or a 
hdt of his hair or a paring from his finger nail rmd I would know 
dtem because I believe now that I have known what his hair and 
Us finger nails would look like all my life, could dioose that lode 
and tUit paring out of a thousand. And it did not come, and his 
letter went to her every two weeks and hers came back to 
him, and maybe he thoi^^ If one of mm to her shmdd com 

p6 



back to me unopened then. That would be a si^. And tliat didn’t 
liappen: and then Henry began to talk about his stopping at 
Sutpen’s Hundred for a day or so on his way home and he 
said all right to it, said It will be Henry who will get the letter, 
the letter saying it is inconvenient for me to come at that time; so 
apparently he does not intend to acknowledge me as bis son, but at 
least I shall have forced him to admit that I am. And that one did 
not come either and the date was set and the family at Sut- 
pen s Hundred notified of it and that letter did not come 
either and he thought It will he then; I wronged him; maybe 
tkb is what he has been waiting for and maybe his heart sprang 
then, maybe he said Yes. Yes. I will renounce her; I will re- 
nounce love and all; that will be cheap, cheap, even though he say 
to me ‘never look upon my face again; udee my hue and my ac- 
knowledgement in secret, mdgo* I will do that; I will nett even de- 
mand to hiow of him what it was my modm did that Jttttified his 
action toward her and me. So the day came and he and Hairy 
rode the forty miles again, into the gates and up the drive to 
the house. He knew what would be there — the woman 
whom he had seen once and seen through, the girl whom he 
had seen through without even having to see once, the man 
whom he had seen daily, watched out of his fearful intensity 
of need and had never penetrated — ^the mother who had 
taken Hmcy aside before they had been six hours in the 
house on that Christmas visit and infiirmed him of the en- 
^gement almost be&amp;re the fiance had had time to associate 
the daughter’s name with the daughter’s fiice: so that prob- 
ably before they even reached school again, and without his 
beii^ aware that he had dcaie so, Henry had already told 
Bon what was in his mother’s mind, (who had already told 
Bon what was in his); so that maybe before they evon 
started on Son’s socond visit— 0t would he June now and 
what wooM it he in Nttrth Mbsissippit wte vm it you

saids the magnolias in bloom and the mockingbirds, and in 
fifty years more, after they had gone and fought it and lost 
it and come back home, &amp;e Decoratioa Day and die veter- 
ans in the neat brushed hand-ironed gray and the spurious 
bronze medals that never meant anything to begm with, and 
the chcnen young girls in white dresses bound at the waist 
with crimson sashes and the band would play Dbde and all 
the old doddering men would ydl that you would not have 
thought would have had wind enough to get there, walk 
down town to sit on the rostrum even) — ^it would be June 
now, with the m^olias and mockingbirds in the moon- 
light and the curtains blowing in the June air of Commence- 
ment, and the music, fiddles and triangles, inside among the 
swirling and dipping hoops: and Henry would be a litde 
tight, that should have been saying ‘I demand to know your 
intentions toward my sister’ but wasn’t saying it, instead 
maybe blushing again even in the moonlight, but standing 
straight and blushing because when you are proud enough 
to be humble you dont have to cringe (who every tinK: he 
breathed over his vocal chords he was saying We belong to 
you; do as you will with us), saying ‘I used to think that I 
would hate the man that 1 would have to look at every day 
and whcMse every move and action and sjmh would say to 
me, I have seen and touched parts of your sister’s body that 
you will never see and touch: and now I know that I shall 
hate him and that’s why I want that man to you,’ know- 
ing that Bon would know what he meant, was trying to say, 
tell h i m, thinking, telling himself (Henry): Not just heamx 
he is older dum I am and has known more than I shdl ever hum 
rad has wnettAered more of it; but because of my own five will, 
ifttd whether I knew Uatdte time or not does not matter, I gave 

my Ufc and Judidds both to him 

“That’s not bve,” Quentin said, 

328 



“All right,” Shreve said. “Just listen. — They rode the 
forty miles and into the gates and op to die house. And this 
time Sutpen wasn’t evoi there. And Ellen didn’t even know 
where he had gone, believing blandly and volubly that he 
had gone to Memphis or maybe even to Saint Louis on basi- 
ns, and Hsiry and Judith not even caring that much, and 
only he. Bon, to know where Sutpen had gone, saying to 
himself Of course; he wasnt sure; he had to go there to make sure, 
telling himself that loud now, loud and fast too so he would 
not, could not, hear the thinking, the But if he suspected, why 
not hwe told me? I would have done that, gone to him first, who 
have the blood &lt;fier it was tainted and corrupt by whatever it was 
in mother; loud and fast now, telling himself That's what it is; 
maybe he has gone on ahead to wait for me; hel^no message for 
me here because dte others are not 0 suspect yet W he knows iwt 
1 will know at once where he is when Jfisd himgme, thinking 
of the two of them, the somba^ vengeful woman who was 
his mother and the grim roddike man who had looked at 
him every day for ten days with absolutdiy no alteratian of 
expression at all, faring one another in grim armistice after 
almost thirty yeais in that rich baroque drawing room in 
that house which he called home sinux apparently everybody 
seemed to have to have a home, the man whom he was now 
sure was his father not humble now either (and he. Bon, 
proud of that), not saying even now I was wrong hut I admit 
that it is so— J(Kus, think of hds heart then, during those two 
days, with die old gal throwieg Judith at hum every minu te 

now because she had been sprea^ng the news of the enga^ 
ment confidentially through die county ever since Christ- 
inas — didn’t your father say how she had even taken Judith 
to Memphis in the spring to buy the trousseant — and Judith 
neidier haviig to acc^e to the throwirg nor to resist it but 
just being. Just existing and breathing like Henry did who 

329 



maybe one morning during that spring waked up and lay 
right still in the bed and took stock, added the figures and 
drew the balance and told himself. All right. I am trying to 
make myself into what I think he wants me to be; he can do any- 
thing he wants to with me; he has only to tell me what to do and I 
will do U; even though what he asked me to do looked to me like 
dishonor, I would still do it, only Judith, being a female and 
so wiser than that, would not even consider dishonor: she 
would just say. All right. I will do anything he might ask me to 
do and dtat is why he will never ask me to do anything that I eon- 
dder dishonorMe: so dbat (maybe he even kissed her that 
time, the first time she had ever been kissed maybe and she 
too innocent to be coy or modest or even to know that she 
had been temporized with, maybe afterward just looking at 
him widi a kind of peaceful and blank surprise at the fact 
that your sweetheart apparendy kissed you the first time like 
your brother would — ^provided of course that your brother 
ever thought of, could be brought to, kissing you on the 
mouth) — ^so that when the two days were up and he was 
gone again, and Elkn shrieking at her, ‘What?’ No engage- 
ment, no troth, no ring?’ she would be too astonished even 
to lie abotu it because that would be the first time it would 
have occurred to her that there had been no proposal — 
Ihink of his heart then, while he rode to the River, and then 
on the steamboat itself where he walked up and down the 
deck, feeling through the deck the aigines driving him nearer 
and nearer day and night to the moment which he must have 
realized now he had been waiting for ever since he had got 
big aaough to comprehend. Of coune every now and dioi 
he would have to say it pretty fast and loud. That's all it is. He 
wants to make sure first to drown out the old But why do it 
Ais utay? Why not back there? Hedmows that [shall never mdte 
my claim uyen my part of what he now possesses, gamed at the 



price of what sacrifice and endurance and scorn {so they told me; 
not he: they) only he htms; knows that so well diat it would 
never have ocam^ to him just as he knows it would never occur to 
me that this might he his reason, who is not only generous but ruth^ 
less, who must have surrendered everything he and modter owned 
to her and to me as the price of repudiating her, not because the 
doing it this way hurt him, flouted him and kept him in sus- 
pense that much unnecessary longer, because he didn’t mat- 
ter; whether he was irked or even crucified didn’t matter: it 
was the fact that he had to be kept constantly reminded that 
he would not have done it thh way himself, yet he had 
Stemmed from the blood after whatever it was his mother 
had been or done had tainted and corrupted it — ^Nearer and 
nearer, until suspense and puzzlement and haste and all 
seemed blended into one sublimation of passive surrender in 
which he thought only AR righL All right. Even this way. 
Even if he wants to do it dtis way. 1 uHll pronax never to see ha 
i^ain. Neva to see him again. Ihen he reached home. And he 
never learned if Sutpen had been there or not He never 
knew. He believed it, but he nevar knew— his mother the 
same somber unchangol fiorce paranoiac whom he had lefi 
in September, firom whom he could leam nothing by indi- 
iBction and whom he dared not a^ outright— the very fiuJ 
that he saw through the skillful questions of the lawyer (as 
to how he had liked the school and the people of that coun- 
try and how perhaps — or had he not perhaps? — ^hc had made 
fiiends up there among the country fiunilira) only that much 
more proof to him at that time that Sutpen had not been 
there, or at least the lawyer was not aware that he had, ancc 
now that he believed he had fathomed the lawyer’s design 
in sending him to that particular school to begin with, he 
saw notliing in the questions to indicate that the lawyer had 
learned anydiing new since. (Or what he c»ald have learned 

331 



ia that interview with the lawyer, because it would be a 
Aort one; it would be next to the shortest one ever to tran- 
spire between them, the shortest one of all next to the last 
one of course, the one which would occur in the next sum- 
mer, when Henry would be with him.) Because the lawyer 
would not dare asking him outright, just as he (Bon) did 
not dare to ask his mother outright. Because, though the 
lawyer believed him to be rather a fool than dull or dense, 
yet even he (the lawyer) never for one moment believed 
that even Bon was going to be the kind of a fool 1» was go- 
ing to be. So he told the lawyer nothing and the lawyer told 
hitti nothing, and the summer passed and September came 
and still the lawyer (his mother too) had not once asked him 
if he wanted to return to the school. So that at last he had to 
say it hims elf, that he intended to return; and maybe he knew 
that he had lost that move since there was nothing whatever 
in tiK lawyer’s fece save an agent’s acquiescence. So he re- 
turned to school, where Henry was waiting (oh yes; waiting) 
for him, who didnot even say ‘You didn’t answer my lettm. 
You didn’t even write to Judith’ who had already said What 
nty sister &lt;md I have and are belongs to you but maybe he did 
write to Judith now, by die first nigger post which rode to 
Sutpen’s Hundred, about how it had been an uneventfiil 
summer and hence nothing to write about, with maybe 
Charles Bon plain and inelidabie on the outside of the en- 
vdope and he thinking He will have to see that. Maybe he will 
send it bade thinking Maybe if it comes back nothing will stop me 
dm and so maybe a last / unit know what I am going to do. But 
tt dkjn’t come back. And the others didn’t come back. And 
the passed and Christmas came and they rode again to 
Sutpen’s Hundred and this time Sutpen was not there again, 
he was in the field, he had gone to town, he was hundi]^— 
smdnng; Snt|CQ. not there when they rode up and Bon 



knew iie had not expected him to be there, sayii^ Now. 
Now. Now. If will com now. U will com this tim, and I am 
young, young, because I still dont know what I am going to do. 
So maybe what he was doing that twilight (because he knew 
that SuQ&gt;en had returned, was now in the house; it would 
be like a wind, something, dark and chill, breadbing upon 
him and he stopping, grave, qmet, alert, thinking n4flf? 
Wh(^ is it? Thrat he would know; he could fed the ofeer 
entering the house, and he would let his held breath go quiet 
and &amp;sy, a profound exhalation, his heart-quiet too) in the 
garden while he walked with Judith and talked to her, gal- 
lant and d^ant and automatic (and Judith thinking about 
that like she thought about that fim k^ back in the summer: 
So dtat*s it, That*s what love is, blu&lt;%eoned oiux more by dis- 
appointment but still unbowed)^ — ^maybe what he was ^ing 
there now was waiting, telling himself Maybe even yet he wM 
send form. At least say U tom even though he knew bmen 
He is bt ike library now, he has seM the nigger for Hmry, now 
Hewy is CHfei% ^ f&lt;w«; so that maybe he stopped aid fec^ 
her, with something in his fece that was smffing now, and 
took ho: by die elbows and turned her, easy and gende, un- 
til she faced the house, and said ‘Go. X wi^ to ^ alone to 
think about love’ and die went just as dte took the kiss that 
day, with maybe the fed of the dat of hh hand light and 
momentary upon her behind. And he stood thece fedng the 
house until Henry came out, and they looked at one another 
for a while with no word said and dien turned and walked 
togdher through the garden, across the lot and into t^ 
staUe, where naaybe t&amp;ie was a ni^er there and maybe 
dbey saddled the two boises themselves and waited until ds 
house came with the two repacked saddd»gs. And 
maybehe didn’t even say then, ‘But he sent no urord to met’ ” 
Shteve ceased. 'Xhat is, fer all the two them, and 



Quendn, knew he had stopped, since for all the two of diem 
knew he had never b^un, since it did not matter (and pos- 
sibly neither of them conscious of the distinction) which one 
had been doing the talking. So that now it was not two but 
four of diem riding the two horses through the dark over 
the frozen December ruts of that Christmas Eve: four of 
them and then just two — Charles-Shreve and Quendn- 
Henry, the two of them both believing that Henry was 
thinking He (meaning his father) has destroyed us all, not for 
one moment thinking He (meaning Bon) must have knoum or 
at lea^ suspected this all the time; that's why he has acted as he has, 
why he did not answer my letters last summer nor write to Judith, 
why he has never asked her to marry him; believing that that 
must have occurred to Hairy, certainly during that moment 
after Henry emerged firom the house and he and Bon looked 
at one anodier for a while without a word then walked down 
to the stable and saddled the horses, but that Etenry had just 
taken that in stride because he did not yet believe it evai 
thot^h Ik knew that it was true, because he must have now 
unckrstood with complete despair the secret of his whcde 
attitude toward Bon ficom that first instinctive moment 
whm he had seen him a year and a quarter ^o ; he knew, yet 
he did mot, had to refuse to, believe. So it was four of them 
who rode the two horses through that night and dien across 
the br%ht firosty North Mississippi Christmas day, in some- 
thing TCry like pariah-hood passing the plantation houses 
with spri^ of holly thrust beneath the knockers on the doors 
and mistletoe hangup firom the chandeliers and bowk of 
^gnog and toddy on tables in the balk and the blue un- 
winded wood smoke standing above the plastered chimneys 
of the dave quartos, to die River and the steamboat. There 
wotdd be Christmas on the boat too: the same holly and 
mkdcfioei the same and toddy; peiha|s, doubtless, a 



Christmas supper and a ball, but not for them: the two of 
them m the duk and the cold standing at the guard rail above 
the dark water and still not talking since dicre was nothing 
to say, the two of them (the four of them) held in that pro- 
bation, that suspension, by Henry who knew but still did not 
believe, who was going dehberately to look upon and prove 
to himself that which, so Shreve and Qucnan believed, 
would be like deadi for him to learn- So it was four of them 
still who got off the boat in New Orleans, which Henry had 
never seen before (whose entire cosmopolitan experience, 
apart from his sojourn at the school, consisted probably of 
one or two trips to Memphis with his father to buy live 
stock or slaves) and had no time to look at now— Henry who 
knew yet did not believe, and Bon whom Mr Compson had 
called a fatalist but who, according to Shreve and Quentin, 
did not resist Henry’s dictum and design for the reason that 
he neither knew nor cared what Henry intended to do be- 
cause he lutd long since realized that he did not know yet 
what he himself was goii^ to do — four of them who sat in 
that drawing room of baroque and fusty magnificence which 
Shreve had invented and which was probably true mou^ 
while the Haiti-bom daig;hter of the French sugar plantCT 
and the woman whom Sutpen’s first frtlKr-in-law h^ tola 
him was a Spaniard (the slight dowdy woman with untidy 
gray-streaked raven hair coarse as a horse’s tail, with parch- 
ment-colored skin and implacable pouched black eyes which 
alone showed no age because they showed no foigetting, 
whom Shreve and Quentin had likewise invented and whidb 
was likewise probably true enough) told them nothing be- 
cause she did not need to because die had already told it, who 
did not say, *My son is in love with your sistere’ bttt ‘So she 
has fallen in love with him’ and thea sat latching hazily 
and stse^y at Henry who could not have Ikd to Iw even i£ 



he would have, who did not even have to answer at all either 
Yes or No. — ^Four of them there, in that room in New Or- 
leans in i8do, just as in a sense there were four of them here 
in this tomblike room in Massachusetts in 1910. And Bon 
may have, probably did, take Henry to call on the octoroon 
mistress and the child, as Mr Compson said, thoi^h neither 
Shreve nor Quentin believed that the visit affected Henry 
as Mr Compson seemed to think. In fact, Quentin did not 
even tell Shreve what his father had said about die visit. 
Perhaps Quentin himself had not been listening when Mr 
Compson related it that evening at home; perhaps at that 
moment on the gallery in the hot September twilight Quen- 
tin took that in stride without even hearing it just as ^icve 
would have, since both he and Shreve believed — and were 
probably right in diis too — ^that the octoroon and the child 
would have b«n to Henry only something else about Bon 
to be, not aivied but aped if that had been possible, if there 
had been time and peace to ape it in— peace not betweai 
men of the same race and nation but peace between two 
young embattled spirits and the incontrovertible fact which 
embattled them, since neither Henry and Bon, anymore fhart 
Quentin and Shreve, were the first young men to believe (or 
at least apparently act on the assumpticHi) that wars were 
sometimes created for the sole aim of settling youth’s private 
difficulties and discontents. 

“So the old dame asked Henry that one question and thpt^ 
sat there laighiig at him, so he knew then, they both knew 
And so now it would be short, this time with the law- 
yer, the shortKt one of all. Becaoto the law3rer would have 
been watching him; maybe there had even been a letter 
dortug that second while the lawyer was waiting and 
stffl itothing seemed to bo happening diete (and maybe 
dbe kwjw, was the leasMi why Bon never «asweicd Hbir/s 



and Judith’s ktters darii^ that summer: because he never got 
them) — a leoer, two or maybe three pages of your humble 
and obedimt e and t and c that boiled down to dghteen 
words I hiow you are afoot, but just what kind of a fool are you 
going to he? and Bon was at least enough of a not-fool to do 
the boiling down. — Yes, watdung him, not concerned yet, 
just considerably annoyed, giving Bon plenty of time to 
come to him, giving him ^ of a week maybe (after he-the 
lawyer — -would have contrived to get hold of Henry and find 
ottt a good deal of what Henry was thinking without Henry 
ever knowing it) before he would contrive Bon too, and 
maybe so good at the contriving that even Bon would not 
know at once what was coming. It would be a short one. It 
would be no secret between them now; it would just be unr* 
said: the lawyer behind dm desk (and maybe in the secret 
drawee the ledger where he had just finished adding in lie 
last past year’ s interest compounded between the intrinsic 
and the love and pride at two hundred percent.) — the lawyer 
firetted, annoyed, but not at all concerned since he not only 
knew he had the screvre, hut he still did not really believe 
that Bon was that kind of a fiml, though be was about to 
alter bis opinion somewhat about the d]dlness,or at least the 
badkwardness— die lawyer watximg him and saying, smoodi 
and oily, ance it would be no axrct now, who would know 
now that Bon knew all he would ever know or would need 
to know to make the coup: *Do you know that you are a 
very fisrtanate young man? Whh most of us, even when vre 
are ludky enoi^ to get our revenge, we must pay for it, 
sometimes in actual dollars. While you are not caily in a

337 



ve lils^ it or not, may be had only in exchange for hard dol- 
lars — and Bon not saying What do you mean? and not mov- 
ing yet; that is, the lawyer would not be aware that he was 
beginning to move, continuing (the lawyer) smooth and 
easy: ‘And more than this, than the revenge, as lagniappe to 
the revenge as it were, this nosegay of an afternoon, this 
scentless prairie flower which will not be missed and which 
might as well bloom in your lapel as in another’s; (his — ^How 
do you young men put it ? — sl nice litde piece — ’ and (hen 
he would see Bon, maybe the eyes, maybe he would just 
hear the feet moving. And then, pistol (derringer, horse pis- 
tol, revolver, whatever it was) and all, he would be crouched 
back against the wall behind the overturned chair, snarling, 
‘Stand back! Stop!’ then screaming ‘Help! Help! Ffc — !’ 
then just screaming, because he would hear and feel his own 
wrenching bones before he could free his fingers of the pistol, 
and his neck bone too as Bon would strike him with die 
palm on one cheek and then with the back of the hand on 
the odwr; maybe he could even hear Bon too saying, ‘Stop 
it. Husk I’m not going to hurt you’ or maybe it was the law- 
yer in him that said the Hush whidh he obeyed, who got 
him back into the righted chair again, half lying upon the 
desk; the lawyer in him, that warned him not to say You will 
pay for this but instead to half lie thore, nursing his wrenched 
hand in his handkerchief while Bon stood looking down at 
him, holding the pistol by the barrel against his leg, sayiig, 
‘tf you fed that you require satisfaction, of course you 
know—’ and the lawyer, sitting back now, dabbing the 
handkerdtuef at his cheek now: ‘1 was wrong. I misunder- 
m»d your feding about the matter. I ask your pardon’ and 
&amp;}n: ‘Granted. As you wish. I will aoxpt either an apolc^y 
or a bullet, as you prefer* and the lawyer (th^ would be a 
&amp;int£idhg red in his cheeh, but that would be all: nothing 



m tihe voice or in the eyes): ‘I see you are going to collect 
full measure for my unfortunate misconception — even ridi- 
cule. Even if I fHt that right was on my side (which I do not) 

I would soil have to decline your oflfer. I would not be your 
equal with pistols’ and Bon: ‘Nor with knives or rapiers 
toot’ and the lawyer, smooth and easy: ‘Nor knives or rapi- 
ers too.’ So diat now the lawyer wouldn’t even need to say 
You will pay for this because Bon would be sayit^ that for 
h i m , who would stand there with the lax pistol, thinking 
But only with knives or pistols or rapiers. So I cant beat him* I 
could shoot him. I would shoot him with no more compunction 
than I would a snake or a mat who cuckolded me. But he would 
still heat me. Thinking Yes. He did beat me while he— he — 
(Listen,” Shreve said, cried. “It would be wHle he would be 
lying in a bedroom of that private house in Corinth afier 
Httsburg Landing whik his shoulder got well two years 
later and die letter from the octoroon (maybe even the one 
that contained the photograph of her and the chiU) finally 
overtaking him, wailmg for money and telling him that the 
lawyer had departed for Texas or Mexico or somewhere at 
last and that ^ (the octoroon) could not find his mother 
either and so without dorht the lawyer had murdered her 
before he stole the money, since it would be just like bodi 
of them to flee or get themselves killed without providing 
for her at alL)— Yes, they knew now. And Jesus, think of 
him. Bon, who had wanted to know, who had had the mc^ 
reason to want to know, who as far as he knew had never 
bad any fadier but had been cre^d somdbow between dut 
woman who wouldn’t let him play with other childim, and 
that lawyer who even told the woman whether or not eadh

people neither of whom had takm pleasure or found passion

"wjbo peiiiaps if one of the two had only told him the truth, 
none of what happened would ever have come to pass; 
while there was Henry who had father and security and con* 
tenement and all, yet was told the truth by both of them 
while he (Bon) was told by neither. And think of Henry, 
who had said at first it was a lie and then when he knew it 
was not a lie had still said *I dont believe it,’ who had found 
even in that ‘I dont believe it’ enough of strength to repudi- 
ate home and blood in order to champion his defiance, and 
in which dbampioning he proved his contention to be the 
fiilse one and was more than ever interdict against returning 
home; J«us, think of the load he had to carry, bom of two 
Methodises (or of one long invincible line of Methodists) 
and raised in provincial North Mississippi, faced with incest, 
incest of all things that might have been reserved for him, 
diat all his hetedity and training had to rebel against on 
principle, and in a sittiadon where he knew that neither in- 
cest nor training was going to help him solve it. So that 
maybe when they left and walked the streets th^ n%ht and 
^ W Bon said, ‘Well? Now what?’ Henry said, ‘Wait. Watt, 
let me get used to it’ And maybe it was two days or three 
days, and Itory said, ‘You shall not Shall not’ and then it 
was Bon that said, ‘Wait I am your older brother: do you 
say shall nci to me?’ And maybe it was a week, maybe Bon 
took Henry to see the octoroon and Henry looked at her 
and said, that enough for you?’ and Bon said, ‘Do you 
want it te be enough?’ and Hairy said, ‘Wait Wait I must 
have time to get u^ to it You will have to give me time.* 
Jesus, think how Henry must have talked during that winter 
and then that spring with Lincoln elected and the Alabatna 
emvention and the South began to draw out of the Union, 
and dten there were two piesadents in the United States and 
foe tele^^E^ bzc«^ the news about Charleston and litt* 



coin called out Iiis aimy and it was done, irrevocable now, 
and Henry and Bon already decided to go without having 
to consult one another, who would have gone anyway even 
if they had never seen one another but certainly now, because 
after all you dont waste a war — tbinlc how Aey must have 
talked, how Henry would say, ‘But must you marry hert 
Do you have to do it?’ and Bon would say, ‘He should have 
told me. He should have K&gt;ld me, myself, himself I was for 
and honorable with him. I waited. You know now why I 
waited. I gave him every chance to tell me himscE But he 
didn’t do it. If he had, 1 would have agreed and promised 
never to see her or you or him again. But he didn’t tell me. 
I thought at fiist it was because he didn’t know. Then I knew 
that he did know, and still I waited. But he didn’t tell me. 
He just told you, sent me a message like you send a com- 
mand by a n%ger servant to a b^ar or a tramp to dear out. 
Dont you see that;’ and Hairy would say, ‘But Judith. Our 
sister. Think of her’ and Bon: ‘All right. Think of her. Then 
what?’ because they both knew what Judith would do when 
she fmnd it out because they both koew that women will 
show prule and honor about almost anything except love, 
and Henry said, “Yes. I see. I understand. But you will have 
to me time to get used to it. You ate my older brother; 

you can do that little fiar me.’ Think of the two of them: 
Bon who didn’t know what he was going to do and had to 
say, pretend, he did; and Henry who knew what he was 
going to do and had to say he didn’t. Then it was Cfaxi^inas 
a^m, thm z86z, and they hadn’t heard from Judith becausse 
Judith didn’t know for sure whem they were because Henry 
wouldtf t let Bm write to ho: yet; then they heard about the 
company, the Univainty Grays, organizbg up at Oxford 
aiid maybe titey had been waiting for that. So dtey to(^ the 
North mmw and e»ettt»rw«aic rm

tlifi boat now than Cbxistmas even, like it always is wben a 
war starts, before the scene gets cluttered up with bad food 
and wounded soldiers and widows and orphans, and them 
taking no part in it now either but standing at the rail agdn 
above the dniming water, and maylw it would be two or 
three days, then Henry said suddenly, cried suddenly: ‘But 
kin^ have done it ! Evm dukes I There was that Lorraine duke 
named John something that married his sister. The Pope 
exconununicated him but it didn’t hurt! It didn’t hurt ! Hiey 
were still husband and wife. They were still alive. They still 
loved!’ then again, loud, fest: ‘But you will have to wait! 
You will have to give me time! Maybe the war will settle it 
and we wont need to!’ And maybe this was one place where 
your old man was tight: and they rode into Oxford without 
touching Sutpen’s Hundred and signed the company roster 
and thai hid somewhere to wait, and Henry let Bon write 
Judith one letter, they would send it by hand, by a nigger 
diat would steal into the quarters by night and give it to 
Judith’s maid, and Judith sent the picture in the metal case 
and they rode on ahead to wait until the company got through 
making flags and riding about the state telling ^ds farewell 
and started for the front. 

“Jesus, think of them. Because Bon would know what 
Henry was doing, just as he had always known what Haury 
was thinking since that first day when they had looked at one 
another. Maybe he would know all the better what Henry 
was doing b^use he did not know what he himself was go- 
ing to do, that he would not know until all of a sudden some 
day it would hurst dear and he would know then that he had 
known all dbe time what it would be, so be didn’t have to 
bother about himself and so all he had CO do was just to watchi 
Henry trying to recondle what he ^leary} knew he was go- 
ing to do all the vofees of ^ hocoliiy and training 



wbidbi said No. No. You camot. You must not. You shdl not. 
Maybe they would even be under fire now, with the shells 
rushing and rumbling past overhead and bunting and them 
lying there waiting to charge and Henry would cry again, 
‘But that Lorraine duke did it! There must have been lots in 
die world who have done it that people dont know about, 
(hat maybe they suffered for it and di^ for it and are in hell 
now fisc it. But they did it and it dont matter now; even the 
ones we do know about are just names now and it dont mat- 
ter now’ and Bon watching him and listening to him and 
rbitiking l£s because I dont ^ow myself what I am going to do 
and so he is aware that I am undecided unthout knowing that he is 
aware. Perhaps if I told him now that I am going to do it, he would 
know his own mind and tell me, You shall not. And maybe 
your old man was right riiat time and they did t h i n k maybe 
the war would settle it and they would not have to them- 
selves, or at least maybe Henry hoped it would because 
maybe your old man was r%ht here too and Bon Hida’ t cate; 
tbar sincE both of the two people who could have ^ven him 
a father had declined to do it, nothing mattered to him now, 
reverse or love or aB, smee he knew now that levenge could 
not conqjensate him nor love assuage. Maybe it wam’t even 

Hfenry who wouldn’t let him write to JudiA but Bon himself 

who did not write her becaum he didn’t care abmit anything, 
not even that he didn’t know yet what he was going to &lt;1o. 
Then it was the next year and Bon was an officer now and 
they were moving toward Shiloh wuhout knowii^ that 
either, tallcing again as they moved along in column, tlw 
officer dropping back alongside the file in which the private 
marched and Henry crying again, holding his desperate and 
urgent voice down to undettone: ‘Doat you know yet what 
you ate gomg to dot* while Bern would look at him fisr 4 
-with that espresskm which could, have been fflaib

ing: ‘Suppose I told you I did not intend to go back to her?* 
and Henry would walk there beside him, with his pack and 
his eight fat of musket, and he would begin to pant, pant- 
ing and panting while Bon watched him: ‘I am out in front 
of you a lot now; going into battle, charging, I will be out 
in front of you — and Henry panting, ‘Stop! Stop!’ and 
Bon watschiiig him with that faint thin expression about the 
mouth and eyes: * — ^and who would ever know? You would 
not even have to know for certain yourself, because who 
could say but what a Yankee ball might have struck me at 
the exact second you puUed your trigger, or even before — * 
and Henry panting and looking, glaring at the sky, with 
his teeth showing and the sweat on his face and the knuckles 
of the hand on his musket butt white, saying, panting, ‘Stop! 
Stop! Stop! Stop!’ Then it was Shiloh, the second day and 
the lost battle and the brigade falling back from Pittsburgh 
Landing— And listen,” Shreve cried; ‘‘wait, now; wait!” 
glaring at Quentin, panting himself, as if he had had to 
supply his shade not only with a cue but with breath to 
obey it in): “Because your old man was wrong here, too! 
He said it was Bon who was wounded, but it wasn’t. Because 
who told him? Who told Sutpcn, or your grandfrther either, 
which of them it was who was hit? Sutpen didn’t know be- 
cause he wasn’t there, and your grandfather wasn’t there 
eidier because that was where he was hit too, where he lost 
his arm- So who told them? Not Henry, because his frdier 
aever saw Henry but that one time and maybe they never 
had time to talk about wounds and besides to talk about 
wounds in dhe Confederate army in 1865 would be like coal 
miners talking about soot; and not Bon, because Sutpen 
never saw him at all because he was dead— it was not Bon, 
it was Henry; Bon that fr&gt;tmd Henry at last and smoped to 
np and Henry fchgbt back, sayii^ *Let 



be! Let me die! I wont have to know it then’ and Bon said, 
‘So you do want me to go back to bet’ and Henry lay there 
struggling and panting, with the sw'eat on his face and his 
teeth bloody inside his diewed lip, and Bon said, ‘Say you do 
want me to go back to her. Maybe then I wont do it Say it’ 
and Henry lay there struggling, with the hresh red stanung 
through 1^ shirt and his teeth showing and the sweat on his 

£iceuntilBon held his arms andliftedhim onto his back ” 

Brat, two of them, then four; now two again. The room 
was mdeed tomblike: a (quality stale and static and moribund 
beyond any mere vivid and living cold. Yet they remained 
in it, though not thirty feet away was bed and warmth. 
Quentin h^ not even put on his overcoat, which lay on the 
floor where it had flilW 6:om the arm of the chair where 
Shreve had pot it down. They did not retreat &amp;om the cold. 
They both bore it as though in deliberate flagdlant exaltation 
of physical misery transmogrified into the spirits’ tras^ of 
the two young men during that time fifty years agp, or 
fbrty-dght rather, then forty-seven and then forty-six, since 
it was ’64 and then ’65 and the starved and ts^ed remnant 
o£ an army having retreated across Alabama and Georj^ and 
into Carolina, swqpt onward not by a victorious army be- 
hind ft but rather by a mounting tide of the mam of lost 
battles from either ride— Chickamauga and Banklin, Vidts- 
burg and Coriiuh and Atlanta— battle lost not alone because 
of superior numbera and failing ammunition and stores, but 
beca^ of generals who should not have been generals, who

who wore plumes and cloaks lined with scarlet at twenty- 
eight and thirty and thirty-two and captured warships with 
cavalry char^ but no grain nor meat nor bullets, who would 
whip three separate armies in as many days and then tear 
down their own fences to cook meat robbed feom dieir own 
smokehouses, who on one night and with a handful of men 
would gallantly set fire to and destroy a million dollar gar- 
rison of enemy supplies and on the next night be discovered 
by a neighbor in bed with his -wife and be shot to death — 
two, four, now two again, according to Quentin and Shreve, 
the two the four the two still talking — the one who did not 
yet know what he was going to do, the other who knew 
what he would have to do yet could not reconcile himself— 
Henry citing himself authority for incest, ta lk i n g about his 
Duke John of Lorraine as if he hoped possibly to evoke that 
condemned and excommunicated ^de to teU him in person 
that it was all right, as people both before and since have tried 
to evoke God or devil to justify than in what their glands in- 
sisted upon— the two the four the two facing one another in 
the tombhke room: Shreve, the Canadian, the child of bliz- 
zaurds and of cold in a bathrobe with an overcoat above it, 
the collar turned up about his ears; Quentin, the Southerner, 
the morose and deficate offipmg of rain and steamy heat in 
the thin suitable dothing which he had brought firom Mis- 
sissippi, his overcoat (as thin and vain fe&gt;r what it was as the 
suit) lying on the floor where be had not even bothered to 
raise it: 

( ^ winter of *64 now, the army retret^d across AMiama, 

into Georgia; now Carolina was just td their harks and Bon, the 
ofker, thinking *We will either he caugU md annihilate or Old 
Joe wdl extriaste us and we will make contort with Lee in front 
ofRichmond raid then we wiU at leaa have die privikge &lt;f sw- 
rmdff'; and then one day all of a sudden ha mm^ht of it, re- 



membered, haw that Jefferson regiment of which his father was now 
colonel was in Longstreet's corps, mtd maybe from that moment the 
whole purpose of the retreat seemed to him to be that of bringing 
him within recuk of his father, to give his father one more chance. 
So that it must have seemed to him now that he knew at last why 
he had not been (Ale to decide what he wanted to do. Maybe he 
thot^ht for just a second, *My God, I am still young; even after 
these four years I am still young* hit just for a second, because 
maybe in the same breath he said, *AU right. Then I am yotmg. 
But I still believe, even though what I believe probably is that 
war, suffering, dtese four years of keeping his men alive and able 
in order to swap them blood and flesh for the largest amount of 
ground at its bargain price, will have changed him (which I know 
that it does not do) to where he will say to me not: Forgive me: 
but: You are my oldest son. Protect your sister; never see either of 
us again:* Then it was *65 aid what was left of the army of t^ 
West with nothing remaining now but dte abilHy to walk bark- 
ward slow and stubborn and to endure musketry and shelling; may- 
be they didnt even miss the shoes and overcoats and food any more 
now and that was why he could write about the captured Oove 
polish like he did in the letter to Judith when he finally knew what 
he was going to do at last and told Bknry and Henry stud ‘ Thank 
God. Thank God,’ not for the incest of course but because at last 
they were going to do someday, at last he could be something 
even though diat something was the irrevocable repudiation cf the 
old heredity and training and the acceptance of etemd damnation. 
Maybe he could even quit talking (Aout his Lorraine duke dm, 
because he a»dd say now, *It isn’t yours nor his nor the Pop^ s hdl 
that we are all going to: it’s my mothers and her m^het’s and 
fraher’s and their mothat* s and father* s hell, and it isn’t you who 
are gomg there, hut we, the three— no: four of us. And so at lead 
we win all be ^^her wh&amp;e we bdong, since even if only he went 
there we would stSl haue to he there too since the dna of us are

just ilbisions that he begot, and your illusions are a part of you like 
your bones and flesh and memory. And we will all be together in 
torment and,so we will not need to remember love and fornication, 
and maybe in torment you cannot even remember why you are 
there. And if we cannot remember all this, it cant be much torment.* 
Then they were in Carolina, that January and February of '65 and 
what was left of them had been walking backivardfor almost a year 
now and the distance between them and Richmond was less far 
thmi the distance they had come; the distance between them and 
the end a good deal less far. But to Bon it was not the space be- 
tween them and defeat but the space between him and the other 
regiment, between him and the hour, the moment: He will not 
even have to ask me; I tvill just touch flesh with him and I will 
say it myself: You will not need to worry; she shall never see me 
again.* Then March in Carolina and still the walking backward 
slow and stubborn and listening to the Northward now because 
there was nothing to hear from any other direction because in all 
the other directions it was finished now, and all they expected to 
hear from the North was defiat. Then one day (he was an ojflcer; 
he would have known, heard, that Lee had detached some troops 
and sent them down to reinforce them; perhaps he even knew the 
names and nunAers of die raiments before they arrived^ he saw 
Sutpen. Maybe that first time Sutpen aOudly did not see him, 
mt^be that first time he could tell himself, ‘That was why; he 
didn*t see me,’ so that he had to put himself in Sutpen* s way, nudte 
his chance and situation. Then for die second time he looked at the 
exprestionless &lt;md rocMike face, at the pale boring eyes in which 
there was no flicker, nothing, the face in which he saw his own 
features, in wkidi he saw recognition, and that was all. That was 
dl; there was nothing Jurdier now; perlups ht Ju^ breathed once 
qmedy, with on his own face dutt expression which might at a 
fiwice have been cdled smiling while he dmght, *I cpuU force 
■ kmitcoiMgo to him and force him,* Imowitg dtat he woMnot 



hamse it was all fini^d ttotif, dmt was all af it nm and at laM. 
And mayhe it was that same night or maybe a night a week later 
while they were stopped {because even Sherman would have to 
stop sometimes at night) with thejires burning for warmth at least 
because at least warmth is dwap and doesn’t remain consumed, 
that Bon said, ‘Henry’ and said, ‘It wont be much longer now and 
dien there wont he anything left: we wont even have anphing to 
do Ifi, not even the privilege of wtdking backward slowly for a 
reason, for the sdte of honor and what’s left of pride. Not God; 
evidently we have done without Him for four years, only He just 
didn’t tkide to notify us; and not only not shoes and clothing but 
not even any need for them, and not only no land nor any way 
to make food, but no need for die food since we have learned to live 
widwut that too; and so if you dont have God and you dont need 
food and clothes md skelter, dtere isn’t anyddng for honor and

md follow the later. They still wdked backward, slow and stub- 
bom, listening toward the North for the end of it because it takes 
an awjiil lot of character to quit anything when you are losing, and 
dtey had been walking backward slow for a year now so all they 
had left was not the will but just the ability, the grooved habit to 
endure. Then one night they had stopped again since Sherman Iwd 
popped (gain, and an orderly came along the bivouac line and 
jmnd Tknry M last &lt;md said, 'Sutpen, the colonel wants you in 
his tent.') 

“And so you and die old dame, die Aunt Rosa, want out 
there that night and the old nigger Clyde tried to stop you, 
stop her; she held your arm and said, ‘Dont let her go up 
there, young marster’ but you couldn’t stop her either be- 
cause she was strong with forty-five years of hate like forty- 
five years of raw meat and all Clyde had was just forty-five 
or fifty years of despair and waiting; and you, you didn’t 
even want to be there at all to begin with. And you couldn’t 
stop her either and then you saw that Clyde’s trouble wasn’t 
anger nor even distrust; it was terror, fear. And she didn’t 
^ you in so many words because she was sdll keeping that 
secret for the sake ofthe man who had been her father too as 
well as for the sake of the family which no longer existed, 
whose hare-to-fore inviolate and rotten mausoleum she still 
guarded — didn’t tdll you in so many words anymore than 
she tdid you in so many words how she had been in the room 
diat day whan they broi^ht Son’s body in and Judith took 
fiom his pocket the xnetal case she had given him with her 
Ittcture in it; she didn’t tell you, it just came out of the terror 
and the foar afier she turned you loose and caught the Aunt 
Rosa’s arm and the Aunt Rosa turned and struck her hand 
away and went on to the stairs and Clyde tan at her 
and. this time the Aunt Rcea stopped and turned on the sec- 
oijd step and knoclted Clyde down with her fist like a 



would and turned and went on up the stairs: and Clyde lay 
there on the floor, more than eighty years old and not mudh 
more than five feet taE and looking like a little bundle of 
clean rags so that you went and took her arm and helped her 
up and her arm felt like a sack, as light and dr)' and brittle 
as a stick: and she looked at you and you saw it was not rage 
but terror, and not nigger terror because it was not about 
herself but was about whatever it was that was upstairs, that 
she had kept hidden up there for almost four years; and she 
didn’t tell you in the actual words because even in die terror 
she kept the secret; nevertheless she told you, or at least all 
of a sudden you knew 

Shreve ceased again. It was just as well, since he had no 
listener. Perhaps he was aware of it. Ttran suddenly Ik had 
no talker either, though possibly he was not aware of th^ 
Because now neither of diem were there. They were both 
in Carolina and the rime was forty-six years ago, and it was 
not even four now but compounded still further, since now 
both of them were Henry Sutpen and both of them were 
Bon, compounded each of both yet either neither, smellti^ 
the very smoke which had blown and feded away fbrty-ax 
years ago feom the hivotiac foes burning in a pine grove, the 
gaunt and ragged men sitting or lying about them, talking not about 
die ivar yet all curiously enough {or perhaps not curiously at a/i) 
facing the South where further on in the darkness the pickets stood 
— the pickets who, watching to die Sotah, amid see thejiuker and 
gleam of die Federal bivouac foes myriad and faint and encirclir^ 
half die horizon and amndng Un foes for each Confederate one, 
and between whom and which {Rebel picket and Yankee foe) die 
Yankee outposts watdied the darkness also, the two picket lines so 
close tha each could hear die challenge of die others officers passmg 
from post to post and dying away: and when gone, die voice, ht- 
visible, antiious, not hud yet carrying: 


351 



—Hey, Mek 

—Yak 

— Where you fellers going? 

— RJdimond. 

— So are we. Why not wait for us? 

— We air. 

The men about the fires would not hear this exchange, though 
would presently hear the orderly plamly enough as he passes 
fiomfire to fire, asking for Sutpen and being directed on and so 
reaches the fire at last, the smoldering log, with his monotonous 
speech ‘Sutpen? Tm looking fi&gt;r Sutpen until Henry sits up and 
says, ‘Here* He is gaunt and ragged and unshaven; because of the 
lak fouT years and because he had not quite got his height when 
die four years began, he is not as tall by two inches as he gave

— Here, he says— What is it? 

— The colonel wants you.

— Supgm, Henry says — The colonel sent for me. 

The sentry gestures him into the tent. He stoops through the

see it here and now, hut radier because he is not looking at iL Ife 
just salutes the braided cuff &lt;md stands so until tlte other says, 

— Henry. 

Even now Henry does not start. He just stands so, the two of 
them stand so, looking at one another. It is the older man who 
moves first, though they meet in the tenter of the tetit, where they 
embrace and Mss before Henry is aware that he has moved, was 
going 0 move, moved by what of close blood which in the reflex 
instant abrogates and reconciles even though it does not yet {per- 
haps never willj forgive, who stands now while his father holds 
his face between both hands, looking at it. 

— Henry, Sutpen says— My son. 

Then they sit, one on either side of the table, in the chairs re- 
served for officers, the table {an open map lies on it) and the omMe 
between them. 

— You were hit at Shiloh, Colonel Willow tells me, St^pen 
says. 

— Yes, sir, Henry says. 

He is cdmt to say Charles carried me bade hut he does not, be- 
cause already he knows what is coming. He does not even diisdt 
Surely Judith didn't write him about that letter or It was Clytie 
who sent him word somehow that Charles has umtten her. He 
diinks nehber of these. To him it is logical and ncOural that their

wJwre alert pickets face one another and where weary men sleep 
without shelter, waiting for dawn and the firing, the weary hack- 
ward walking to commence again: yet in a second tent candle gray 
and all are gone and it is the holly-decked Christmas library at 
Sutpens Hundred four years ago and the table not a camp table 
suitable for the spreading of maps but the heavy carved rosewood 
one at home with the group photograph of his mother and sister 
and himself sitting upon it, his father behind the table and behind 
his father the window above the garden where Judith and Bon 
strolled in that slow rhythm wh^re the heart matches the footsteps 
and the eyes need only look at one another. 

— You are going to let him marry Judith, Henry. 

Still Henry does not answer. It has all been said before, and now 
he has had four years of bitter struggle following which, whether 
it he victory or defeat which he has gained, at least he has gained 
it and has peace now, even if the peace be mostly despair. 

— He cannot marry her, Henry. 

Now Henry specks. 

— You said that before. I told you then. And now, and now it 
wont he much longer now and then we wont have anything left: 
honor nor pride nor God since God quit us four years ago only He 
never though it necessary to tell us; no shoes nor clothes and no 
need fi&gt;r them; not only no land to make food out of but no need for 
the food and when you dont have God and honor and pride, noth- 
ing matters esaxpt that there is the old mindless meat that dont even 
care if it was drfeat or victory, that wont even die, dud will be otd 
in the woods and fields, grulAing up roots and weeds. — Yes. I 
have decided, Brother or not, I have decided. I will. I will. 

— He must not marry her, Henry. 

— Yes. I said Yes at first, but X was not derided then. I didn*t 
kt him. But now J have had four years to decide in. I will. I ant 
goh^to. 

—He must not marry her, Henry. Ms motkeds^^ter toU me 



dtat her mc&amp;ter had been a Spanish woman. I believed him; it was 
mt until after he was born that I found out that his modwr was 
part ne^o. 

Nor did Henry ever say that he did not remember leaving Ae 
tent. He remenAers all of it. He remembers stooping throu^ the 
entrarux again and passing the sentry again; he remembers walk- 
ing bade down the mt and rutted road, stumbling in the dark among 
the ruts on either side of which the fires have now died to embers, 
so that he can bately distinguidi the men sleeping on the earth 
abofd them. Jt must be better than eleven oclock, he thinks. And 
another eight miles tomorrow. If it were only net for those damned 
guns. Why doesn’t Old Joe give the guns to Sherman. Then we 
mdd make twenty miles a day. We could Join Lee then. At least 
Lee stops and fights some of the time. He remembers it. He re- 
members how he did not return to his fire but slopped presently in a 
lonely place and leaned against a pine, leaning qui^y and easily, 
with his head hack so he could look up at Ae shabby sludgy 
branches like something in wrought iron spreading matiotdess 
against the chdl vivid stars of early spring, thinking I hope he re- 
members to thank Colonel Willow for letting us use his tent, 
thinking not what he would do but what he would have to do. 
Beamse he knew what he would do; it now depended on what Bon 
would do, would force him to do, since he knew Aat he would do 
it. So I must go to him, he. thought, Ainldng, Now it is better 
than two oclock and it mil he dawn soon. 

Then it was dawn, or dmost, and it was cold: a chill which 
sttuck through the worn ptttched Ain doAmg, through the some- 
thing of weariness and undernourishment; the passive ability, n&lt;^ 
Ae volitiond will, to endure; there was light somewhere, enough 
of it for him to distinguish Son’s sleeping face from among Ae 
oAers where he /&lt;iy mapped in his Motets, hen&amp;ath his spread 
cloak; enough Ugm for Hm to wake Bon by and for Bon ttf dis- 

3S5 



anguish his face {or perhaps something commumcated by Henry's 
hand) because Bon does not speak, demand to knotv tuho it is: he 
merely rises and puts the cloak about his shoulders and approaches 
the smoldering f re and is kicking it into a blaze when Henry 
speaks: 

—Wait. 

Bon pauses and looks at Hettry; now he can see Henry* s face. 
He says, 

— You will be cold. You are cold now. You haven t been asleep, 
have you? Here. 

He swings the cloak from his shotdders and holds it out. 

— No, Henry says. 

— Yes. Take it. I’ll get my blanket. 

Bon puts the cloak about Henry and goes and takes up his 
tunAled blanket and swings it about his shoulders, and they move 
aside and sit on a log. Now it is dawn. The east is gray; it will be 
primrose soon and then red with firing and once more Ae weary 
backward marching will begin, retreating from annihilation, fidU 
ing bath upon dt^at, though not quite yet. There will be a little 
time yet for them to sit side by side upon the log in Ae nuddng 
/gfe of dawn, the one in the doth, the other in Ae blanket; Adr 
voices are not much louder than the silent dawn itself: 

— So ifs the misagenation, not Ae incest, whuA you cant hear, 

Henry doesfdt mswer. 

— And he sent me no word? He did not ask you to send me to 
him? No word to me, no word at all? That was dll he had to do, 
now, today; four years ago or at any time during the four years. 
That was dl. He would not have needed to ask it, re^iire it, of 
me. I would have offered it. I wcmld have said, I will never see hr 
c^in before h could have asked it of me. He did not have to 
tltis, Henry. He didst t need to teU you lama nigger to stop me. 
He 0uU have stispped me witkoia that, Henry. 

—Nal Hemy cries.— No! No! I utiO—Tll — — 



He springs up; his face is leorhing^ Bon can see his teeth within 
the soft beard which covers his sunken cheeks, and the whites of 
Hettry’s eyes as though die eyeballs struggled in their sockets as the 
panting breath straggled in his lungs — the panting which ceased, 
the breath held, the eyes too looking down at him where he sat on 
ike log, the voice now not much louder than an expelled breath: 

— You said, could have stopped you. What do you mean by 
that? 

Now it is Bon who does not answer, who sits on the log looldng 
at the face stooped above him. Henry says, still in that voice no 
louder than breathing: 

— But now? You mean you 

— Yes. What else can I do now? I gave him the choice. I have 
been giving him the choke for four years. 

— Think of her. Not of me: of her. 

— I have. For four years. Of you and her. Noiv I am dtinking 
of myself. 

— No, Henry says. — No. No. 

— I cannot? 

— You shall not. 

— Who will stop me, Sknry? 

— No, Skrtry says, — No. No, No. 

Now it is Bon who watches Henry; he can see the whites of 
Henry s eyes again as he sits looking at Henry with that expression 
whkh might he called smiling. His hand vanishes beseadt the 
Uanket and reappears, holding his pistol by the barrd, the butt 
extended toward Henry. 

— do it now, he says. 

Henry looks at the pistol; new he is not only pcmtit^, he is 
UenMing; when he speeds now his voice is not even ike exkdeh 
law, a is the suffis^ and suffocating inbreath itself: 

’.^Ym ai^ my brother. 


357 



—No I’m not. I’m the nigger th^’s going to sleep with your 
aster. Unless you stop me, Henry. 

Suddenly Henry grasps the pistol, jerks it free of Bans hand 
Oands so, the pistol in his hand, panting and panting; again Bon 
can see the whites of his inr oiled eyes while he sits on the log and 
watches Henry with that faint expression about the eyes and mouth 
which migk be smiling. 

— Do it now, Henry, he says. 

Henry whirls; in the same motion he hurls the pistol from him 
and stoops again, gripping Bon by both shoulders, panting. 

— You shall not! he says. — You shall not! Do you hear me? 

Bon does not move beneath the gripping hands; he sits motion- 
less, with his faint fxed grimace; his voice is gentler than that first 
breath in which the pine branches begin to move a little: 

— You will have to stop me, Henry. “And he never sKpped 
away,” Shreve said. “He could have, but he never even tried. 
Jesus, maybe he even went to Henry and said, ‘I’m going, 
Henry’ and maybe they left together and rode side by side 
dodging Yankee patrols all the way back to Mississippi and 
right up to that gate; side by side and it only then that one of 
them ever rode ahead or dropped behind and that only then 
Henry spurred ahead and turned his horse to £ice Bon and 
took out the pistol; and Judith and Clyde heard the shot, and 
maybe Wash Jones was hanging aroimd somewhere m the 
back yard and so he was there to help Clyde and Judith carry 
him into the house and lay him on the bed, and Wash went to 
town to tell the Aunt Rosa and the Aunt Rosa comes boiling 
out that afternoon and finds Judith standii^ without a tear 
bdbre the closed door, holding the metal case she had given 
him with her picture in it but that didn’t have her picture in 
it now but that of the octoroon and the Hd. And your old 
man wouldn’t know about that too: why the black Km a of 
bitch should have taken har picture out and put the octo- 



toon’s picture in, so he invented a reason for it But I know. 
And you know too. Dont yoai Dont you, huh?” He glared 
at Quentin, leaning forward over die table now, looking 
huge and shapeless as a bear in his swaddling of garments. 
“Dont you know? It was because he said to himself, ‘If 
Henry dont mean what he said, it will be all right; I can 
take it out and destroy it But if he does mean what he said, 
it will be the only way I will have to say to her, I was mgooi; 
do not grieve for m’ Aint that right? Aint it? By God, aint it?” 

“Yes,” Quentin said. 

“Come on,” Shreve smd. “Let’s get out of this 
and go to bed.” 


359 



* IX * 


At £rst, m bed in die dark, it seemed colder than 
ever, as if there had been some puny quality of fsdnt heat in 
the single light bulb before Shreve turned it off and that now 
the iron and impregnable dark had become one with the 
iron and icelike bedclodiing lying upon the flesh slacked and 
dun-dad for deeping. Then the darkness seemed to breathe, 
to flow back; the window which Shreve had opened became 
visible a^inst the faindy unearthly glow of the outer snow 
as, forced by (he weight of the darkness, the blood surged 
and ran warmer, warmer. “University of Mississippi,” 
Shreve’s voice said in the darkness to Quentin’s right “Bay- 
ard attenuated forty miles (it was forty miles, wasn’t it?); 
out of the wilderness proud honor semesterial regurgitant” 

“Yes,” Quaitin said. “They were in the tenth graduating 
class since it was founded.” 

“I didn’t know there were ten in Mississippi that went to 
school at one time,” Shreve said. Quentin didn’t answer. He 
lay watching the rectangle of nwindow, foeling the warming 
blood driving through his veins, his arms and kgs. And now, 
although he was warm and though whfle he hs^ sat in the 
cold room he merely diook fendy and steadily, now he be- 
to jerk all over, violendy and uncontrollably until he 
could even hear the bed, until even Shreve felt it and turned, 
raising himself (by the sound) onto his dbow to look at 
Quentm, thou^ Quentin hinKelf felt perfectly all He 




felt fine even, lying there and waning in peaceful curiosity 
for the next violent unharbingered jerk to conae. “Jesus, arc 
you that cold?” Shreve said. “Do you want me to spread die 
overcoats on you?” 

“No,” Quaitin said. ‘Tm not cold- I’m aD. right I feel 
fine.” 

“Then what are you doing that for?” 

“I dont know. I cant hdip it I feel fine.” 

“All right But let me know if you w'ant the coats. Jesus, 
if I was going to have to spend nine months in this climate, 

I would sure hate to have come from the -South. Maybe I 
wouldn’t come from the South anyway, even if I could stay 
there. Wait. listao. I’m not trying to be fimny, smart. I just 
want to understand it if I can and I dont know how to say 
it better. Because it’s something my people haven’t got. Or 
if we have got it, it all happened long ago saaross the water 
and so now there aint anything to look at every day to re- 
mind us of it. We dont live among defeated grandfethers 
and fireed slave (or have I got it backward and was it your 
folks that are free and the niggers that lost?) and bullets in 
the dining room tabic and such, to he always remi n di n g us 
tso never forget. What is it? something you live and breadie 
m hkf air? a kind of vacuum filfed with wraithlike and in- 
domitable anger and pride and glory at and in happaiings 
that occurred and «ased fifty years ago? a kind of entailed 
fiither and son and father and son of never forgiv- 
ing Gaieral Sherman, so that forevermore as long as your 
dbildiens’ thildren produce children you wont be anydiing 
but a descendant of a long line of colonels kille d in Pfekett s 
charge at Manassas?” 

“Gettysburg,” Quentin said. “You cant understand it. 
You would have to be bom tbere,” 



“Would I dien?” Quentin did not answer. “Do you un- 
derstand It?” 

“I dont know,” Quentin said. “Yes, of course I undentand 
it.” They breathed in the darkness. After a moment Quentin 
said: “I dont know.” 

“Yes. You dont know. You dont even know about the old 
dame, the Aunt Rosa.” 

“Miss Rosa," Quentin said. 

“All right. You dont even know about her. Except that she 
refiised at the last to be a ghost. That after almost fifty years 
she couldn’t reconcile heiself to ktdng him lie dead in peace. 
That even after fifty years she not only could get up and go 
out there to finish up what she found she hadn’t quite com- 
pleted, but she could find someone to go with her and bust 
into that locked house because instinct or somedung told her 
it was not finished yet. Do you;” 

“No,” Quentin said peacefully. He could taste the dust. 
Even now, with the chill pure weight of the snow-breathed 
New England air on his face, he could taste and feel die dust 
of that breathless (rather, furnace-breathed) Mississippi Sep- 
tenaber night. He could even smell the old woman in the 
buggy beside him, smell the fusty camphor-reeking shawl 
and evm die airless bladk cotton umbrella in which (he 
would not discover until they had reached the house) she had 
concealed a hat(het and a flashlight. He could smell the 
horse; he could hear the dry plaint of the light wheels in the 
weighdess permeant dust and he seemed to feel the dust it- 
self move slt^gish and dry across hh sweating flesh just as he 
seemed to hear the single profound suspiradon of the parched 
etuth’s agony rising toward the imponderable and aloof 
stars. Now die spoke, for die first time since they had left 
Jeflerson, rince she had climbed into the buggy with a kind 
of clumsy and fumbling and trembling eagetness (which 1» 

362 



thought derived from terror, ^dann, until he found that he 
was quite wrong) before he couM help her, to sit on the ex- 
treme edge of the seat, small, in the fusty shawl and clutch- 
ing the umbrella, leaning fbrw’ard as if by leaning forward 
she would arrive die sooner, arrive immediately after die 
horse and before he, Quentin, would, before the prescience 
of her desire and need could warn its consummation. 
“Now,” she said. “We are on the Domain. On his land, his 
and Ellen s and Ellen’s descendants. They have taken it away 
from them since, I understand. But it sdll belongs to him, 
to Ellen and her descendants.” But Quentin was already 
aware of that. Before she spoke he had said to himself, ‘Now. 
Now’ and (as during the long hot afternoon in die dim hot 
httle house) it seemed to him that if he stopped the buggy and 
hstened, he might even hear the galloping hod&amp;; m%ht 
even see at any moment now die bl^ stallion and the ridar 
rush across the road before them and gallop on — die rider 
who at one time owned, lode stock: and hand, everything 
he could see from a given poittt, -with every stick and blade 
and hoof and hed on it to remind him (if he ever forgot it) 
that he was the biggest thing in ihdr sight and in his own 
too; who went to war to protect it and lost the war and re- 
turned home to find that he had lost more than the war even, 
thoigh not absolutdy all; who said M least I haue life l^ but 
did not have life but only old age and breadiing and horror 
and scorn and fear and indigoatian: and all remaining to look 
at him with unchanged s^ard was the gid who had been a 
child when he saw her last, who donbtl^ teed t» waidh. him 
from window or door as he passed unaware of her $s 
would have looked at God probably, since cverydbmg else 
within her view bdonged to him too. Maybe he would even 
stop at the cabin and ask fm: water and wotdd take 
bucket and walk the mile and bade to the spring to fistdiit 

363 



fiesh and aK&gt;I him, no more thinking of sayit^ “The 
backet is empty” to him than she wooM have said it to God 
— ^this the not-aH, since at least there was breathing left. 

Now Quentin beg^ to breathe hard again, who had been 
praceful for a time in the warm bed, breathing hard the 
heady pure snowbom darkness. She (Miss Coldfield) did not 
let him enter the gate. She said “Stop” suddenly; he fek her 
hand flutter on his arm and he thought, “Why, she is afraid.’ 
He could hear her panting now, her voice almost a wail of 
diffidfflit yet iron determination: “I dont know what to do. 
I dont know what to do.” (T do,’ he thought. ‘Go back to 
town and go to bed.’) But he did not say it. He looked at the 
two huge rotting gate posts in the starlight, between which 
no gates swung now, wondering firom what direction Bon 
and Henry had ridden up that day, wondering wliat had cast 
the shadow \ndiich Bon was not to pass alive; if some living 
tree which still lived and bore leaves and shed or if some tree 
gone, vanished, burned for warmth and food years ago now 
or perhaps just gone; or if it had been one of the two posts 
themtelves, thinking, wishing that Henry were there now to 
stop Mis Coldfield and turn them back, telling bimself that 
if Henry were there now, there would be no shot to he heard 
by anyone. “She’s going to try to stop me,” Miss Coldfield 
v/hirapered. “I know she is. ^ybe this far feom tovm, out 

here alone at midni^t, she will even let that negro man 

And you didn’t even bring a pistoL Did yout” 

“Nome,” Qftentin said. “What is it she’s got bidden there! 
What a)ald it bet And what diflerenoe does it make; Lot’s 
go back to town, Mi^ Rosa.” 

Sie didn’t answer this at afl. Sbe jua said, “That’s what I 
have got to find oat,” sitting forward on the seat, trembling 
now and peoting up the tneo^iehed drive toward where dte 
tott^db^ the house would b&amp; “And mw, I will have

to find, it out,” she whimpered, ia a loud of amazed Klf-picy . 
She moved suddraly. “Come,” she whispered, beginning to 
get out of the buggy. 

“Wait,” Quentin said- “Let’s drive up to the house. It’s 
a half a mile.” 

“No, no,” she whispered, a tense fierce hissing of words 
filled with that-same curious terrified yet implamble deter- 
mination, as though it were not she who had to go and find 
out but she only the helpl«s agent of someone or something 
else who must know- “Hitch the horse here. Hurry.” Sbe 
got out, scrambled awkwardly down, before he could help 
her, clutching the umbrella. It seemed to him that he could 
still hear hex whimpering panting where she waited dose be- 
side one of the posts while he led the marc from the road and 
tied one rein ak)ut a sapling in the weed-cholmd ditch. He 
could not see her at all, so dc^ she stood against the post: 
die just stepped out and fell in beside him when he pissed 
and turned into the fflte, still brea thing in those whimpering 
pants as they walked on up the ruttol tree-arched drive The 
darkness was intense; she stombfed; he caught her. She took 
his arm, dutfhmg it in a (had r^d hard grip as ifher fingp:^ 
hpr band, were a small mai« Wire. “I Will have to take 
your arm,” she whispered, whimpered. “And you haven’t 
evoi got a pistol — Wait,” she said. She stopped. Ifc tamed; 
he codd not see her but he cotdd hear her hurried breathing 
and than a rustling of doth. Ihcn de was prodding son»- 
tbing at him. “Hmc,” shc whisrperedL *‘Tako it.” It was a 
hattiiet; not right but toudh told him— a hatchet with, a 
heavy worn handle and a heavy gapped rustrduBed blade. 

“Whatf” he sank 

“Talm it!” she whispered, hissed. “You didn’t king a 
mnol It’s somcrim^.” 

"Here^” he said; “writ” 





"CcHne ” she whispeted. “You will have to let me take 
your arm, I am trembling so bad.” They went on. again, she 
clinging to one of his arms, the haudiet in his other hand. 
“We will probably need it to get into the house, anyway,” 
she sai4 stumbling along beside him, almost dragging hitn - 
“I just know she is somewhere watching us,” she vdiimpcred. 
“I can fed her. But if we can just get to the house, get into 

the house ” The drive seemed interminable. He knew 

the place. He had walked from the gate to the house as a 
child, a boy, when distances seem really long (so that to the 
roan grown the long crowcfed mile of his boyhood becomes 
less tha n die throw of a stone) yet now it seemed to him dut 
the house would never come in s%ht: so that presendy he 
found himself repeating her words: ‘If we can just get to the 
house, get inside the house,^ teUing himself, recovering him- 
sdf in that same breath: ‘I am not afeaid. I just dont want to 
be hoe. I just dont want to know about whatever it is she 
keeps hi d de n in it* But they reached it at last It loomed, 
bulked, square and enormous, with jagged half-toppled 
drimaeys, its rot^ine saving a Etde; for an instant as they 
mov^ harried towrard it Quentin saw completely throi^ 
it a ra^ed segment of sky with three hot stats in it as if the 
house were of one dimension, painted on a canvas curtain in 
which there was a tear; now, almost beneath it, the dead 
furnace-breath of air in which they moved seemed to reek 
in dow and protracted violence with a smell of desolation 
and decay as if the wood of whicb it was built were flesh. 
She was trotting hesitk him now, her hand tremhhng on his 
atm yet grilT^ ^ lifeless and rigid strength; 

not talking, not saying words, yet producing a steady whim- 
pering ahncffit a moaning, sound. Apparentiy she could not 
see at all now, so that he had to goii^ her toward where he 
knew ^ would he and then restrain her, wlmp ering-, 



hissing, aping without knowing it her own tense fainting 
haste: “Wait. This way. Be carc^, now. They’re rotten.” 
Ifc almost lifted, carried, her up the steps, supporting her 
firom behind by both elbows as you lift a child; he could, 
feel something fierre and implacable and dynamic driving 
down the thin rigid arms and into his palms and up his own 
arms; lying in the Massachusetts bed he remembered how he 
thought, blew, said suddenly to himself, ‘Why, she’s not 
afeaid at all. It’s something. But she’s not afraid,’ feeling her 
flee out of hfr hands, hearing her feet cross the gallery, over- 
taking her where she now stood beside the invisible front 
door, panting. “Now what?” he whispered. 

“Break it,” she whispered. “It will be locked, nailed. You 
have the hatchet. Break it.” 

“But ” he began. 

“Break it!” die Iflssed. ‘It bdfongal to Slen. I am her 
sister, her only living hdr. Break it. Hurry.” He pushed 
against the door. It did not move;. She panted besii him. 
“Hu^,” she said. “Break it.” 

“Listen, Miss Rosa,” he said. “listen.” 

“Give me the hatdiet.” 

“Wait,” he said. “Do you really want to go inadc?” 

‘Tm going inside,” she whimpered. “Give me the 
hatchet” 

“Wait” he said. Hie mov^ alot^ the gallery, guiding 
himself by the wall, moving carefully since he did not know 
just where the floor planks might be rotten or even misang, 
until he came to a window. Ihe shutters were closed and ap- 
parently Icxhed, yet they ^ve almost at once to the blade of 
die hatchet making not very much sound— a flimsy and 
sloven barricading deme either by an old feeble person — 
woman— or by a diifdess man; he had already inserted the 
hatdhet blade beneath the sash hefeie he discovered that there 

367 



was no glass in it, that all he had to do now was to step 
through the vacant fiame. Then he stood there for a mo- 
ment^ telling himself to go on in, telling himsdfthat he was 
not afiaid, he just didn’t want to know what might be in- 
side. “WeUt” Miss ColdSeld whispered from the door. 
“Have you opened it?” 

“Yes,” he said. He did not whisper, though he did not 
speak overloud; the dark room which he ficed repeated his 
voice with hollow profundity, as an unfurnished room will. 
“You wait Acre. I’ll see if I can open the door.” — ^‘So now 
I shall have to go in,’ he thought, climbing over the s31. He 
knew that the room was empty; the echo of his voice had 
told him that, y^ he moved as dowly and carefully here as 
he had along the gallery, &amp;eling along the vraU with his hand, 
&amp;]lowmg the wall when it turned, and found the door and 
passed throt^ it. He would be in the hall now; he almost 
belkved that he could hear Mbs Coldfield breadung just be- 
yond the w^ beside him. It was pitch dark; he could not 
sec, he knew that he could not see, yet he found that his eye- 
lids and muschs wme aching with strain while merging and 
dissolving red ^ots wheeled and vanished across the retinae. 
He went on; hefhk the door under his hand at last and now 
he could hear Miss Coldfield’s whimpering breathing beyond 
it as he fumbled for the lock. Ihen bdbindhim die sound of 
the scraped mandi was like an etcplosion, a pistol; even he- 
fine the puny following l^t speared all ^ organs lified 
siihenmgly; he could not even move fi&gt;r a moment even 
diof^ scanethicg o£ sanity roared silendy inside his skull: 
*It’s dl r^^l If it were dmger, he woidd not have struck 
the match!' Then he amid move, and tunted to see die tiny 
goontelike creatQie in headrag and vdluminous ddrts, the 
worn coffe-coloted fece staring stt him, the match h^ in 
one and 



he was not watching het hut watching the match as it homed 
down toward her fingers; he watched quiedy as she moved at 
last and lit a second msuch firom-die fint and turned; he saw 
then tie square-ended saw chunk beside the wall and the 
lamp sitting upon it as she lified the chimney and held die 
match to tie wick. He remembered it, lying here in the 
Massachusetts bed and breathii^ fast now, now that peace 
and quiet had fled again. He remembered how she did not 
say one word to him, not IS^o are yout or What do you 
want here’ but merely came with a bunch of enormous old- 
fashioned iron keys, as if she had known all the time that 
this hour must come and that it could not be resisted, and 
opened tie kx&gt;r and stepped back a litde as Miss GiUfield 
entered. And how die (Cl3^} and Miss Coldfield said no 
word to one another, as if Clytk had looked once at the 
other woman and knew that th^ would do no good; that it 
was to him, Quendn, that die tnmeftJ, putting ber hand on 
his arm and sayh^ “Dont let her go up thoe, young 
marstK.” And how maybe she locked at him and knew that 
would do no good either, because she turned and overtook 
Miss Coldfield and caught her atm and said, *‘Dont you go 
op there, Rosie” and Miss Coldfidd struck flbe hand away 
and went on toward the stairs (and now he saw that die had 
a flashli^it; he remembered how he iiotght, *It most have 
been in the umbrella too along with the and Clytm 
said, “Rosie” and tan after tic other again, wlKaccupon Miss 
Coldfield turned on tie step and stiuk dytk to ^ floor 
with a fbll-armed blow like a man would have, and turned 
and went on up the stairs. She (dytk) lay otl the hare floor 
of the scaling and empty hall liire a shapeless bundle of 

qui^ dean rags. , W!m he reached Ikc he saw dbli she was 
quite axaackm, her eyes wile open and cahn; he stood 
abovohtx, drinkit^ ^Yes. ^ae is ^ one vdm owns die ter- 

369 



ror.’ Wlien he raised her it was like piddng a handful of 
sticks conc«tkd in a rag bundle, so light she was. She could 
not stand; he had to hold her up, aware of some feeble move- 
ment or intention in her limbs until he realized that she was 
trying to sit on the bottom stq&gt;. He lowered her to it “Who 
are you?” she said. 

“I’m Quentin Compson,” he answaed. 

“Yes. I remember your gtandpaw. You go up diere and 
mdte bar come down. Make her go away from here. What- 
ever he done, me and Judith and him have paid it out You 
go and get her. Take ifer away from here.” So he mounted 
die stairs, the worn bare treads, the cracked and scaling wdl 
on one side, the balustrade with its intermittent missing 
spindles on the other. Ifc remembered how he looked back 
and she was still sitting as he had left her, and that now (and 
he had not heard hun enter) there stood in the hall below a 
huUdng young l^h^-colorcd negro man in dean faded ov»- 
alls md shirt, his arms dangling, no surprise, no nothing in 
the saddle-colored and slack-mouthed idiot fece. He remem- 
bered how he thought, ‘The sdon, the heir, the apparent 
(thot^h not obvious)’ and how he heard Mrs Coldfidd’s 
feet and saw the light of the torch approachii^ along the 
upper hall and how she came and passed him, how dbe 
stumbled a little and cat^ht herself and looked full at him 
as if she had never seen him before — the eyes wide and un- 
seeing like a sleepwalker’s, the face which had always been 
tallow-hued now possessing some stiH profbunder, some al- 
most unbearable, quality of bloodlessnes— and he thot^t^ 
‘What? What is it now? It’s not shock. And it never has bmi 
fear. Can it be triumph?’ and how she pa^ed him and went 
cm. He heard Clytie say to die man, ‘Take her to gate^ 
d» bt^y’ and he sto^ there foinkiEgi ‘I shctuld gp with 
her’ and don, ‘But I must kc too now. I will have to. May- 

370 



be I shall be sorry tomorrow, bat I must so;,’ So whm he 
came back down the stairs (and he remembered how he 
thought, ‘Maybe my face looks like hers did, but it^s not 
tnumph’) there was only Clytic in the hall, sitting still on 
the bottom step, sitting still in the attitude in which he had 
left her. She did not even look at him when he passed her. 
Nor did he overtake Miss Coldfield and the negro. It was 
too dark to go fast, though he could presmtly hear diem 
ahead of him. She was not using the flashBght now; he re- 
membered how he thought, ‘Surely she cant be afraid to 
show a light now.’ But she was not using it and he wondered 
if she were holding to the negro’s Mm now; he wondered 
that until he heard the negro’s voice, flat, without emphasis 
or interest: ‘Wawkin better over here' and no answer from 
her, though he was close enough now to hear (or believe he 
did) her whimpering panting breath. Then he heard the 
other sound and he knew that she had stumbled and &amp;Qen; 
he could almost sec the hulking slack-faced negro stopped in 
his tracks, loolung toward the sound of the &amp;11, waitii^, 
without interest or curiosity, as he (Qumtin) hurried for- 
ward, hurried toward the voices: 

“You, nigger! What’s your names” 

"Calls nte Jim Bond,” 

“Help me up! You aint any Sutpen! You dont have to 
leave me lying in the dirt!” 

When he stopped the buggy at her gate she did not ofier 
to get out alone this time. She sat diere until he got down 
and came round to her side; she sull sat ihere, clutching the 
umbrella in one hand and the hatchet in the other, until he 
spoke her name. Then she stirred; he helped, lifted her down; 
she was almost as light as Clytie had bem; when she moved 
it was like a madiankal dofl, so that he supported and led 
bsr through the gate and up the short walk and into the doli- 

371 



siz£»i hotEse and turned on the light for her and looked at the 
fixed sleep-walkir^ face, the wide dark eyes as she stood 
there, stili clutchmg the umbrella and the hatchet, the shawl 
and die black dress both stained with dirt where she had 
fallen, the black bonnet jerked fiarward and awry by the 
shock of the fall “Are you all right nows” he said. 

“Yes,” she said. “Yes. I’m all right. Goodnight.” — ^“Not 
thank you,’ he thought: ‘Just goodnight,’ outside the house 
now, breathing deep and fast now as he returned to the 
buggy, finding that he was about to begin to run, thinking 
quietly, ‘Jesus. Jesus. Jesus,’ breathing fast and hard of the 
dark dead fumacc-brcath of air, of night where the fierce 
aloof Stan hung. His own home was dark; he was still using 
the whip when he turned into the lane and then into the 
stable lot. He sprang out and took the mare from the buggy, 
stripping the harness from her and tumbling it into the har- 
ness room without stopping to hang it up, swcaing, breath- 
ing fast and hard; when he turned at last toward the house 
he did begin to run. He could not help it He was twenty 
years old; he was not afraid, because what he had seen out 
there could not harm him, yet he ran; even inside the dark 
familiar hou%, his shoes in his hand, he still ran, up the stairs 
and into his room and began to undress, Bst, sweating, 
breathing fast ‘I ought to bathe,’ he thought: thaa he was 
lying on the bed, naked, swabbing his body steadily with the 
discar&lt;kd shirt, sweating still, panting: so ^t when, his eye- 
muscles aching and straining into dxe darkness and the al- 
most dried shirt still clutched in his hand, he said ‘I have been 
asleep’ it was all the same, there was no difference: waking 
or sleeping he walked dovra that upper hall between the 
scaling walls and beneath the cracked ceiling, toward the 
fidnt light which fell outward from die last door and paused 
dKie, saying ‘No. No* aiul then ‘Only I tawst, I have to’ and 

372 



went in, entered the bare, stafe room whose shutters were 
closed too, where a second lamp burned dimly on a crude 
tabic; waking or sleeping it was the same: the bed, the yel- 
low sheets and pillow, the wasted yellow face v/ith closed, 
almost transparent eyelids on the pillow, the wasted hands 
crossed on the breast as if he were already a corpse; waking 
or sleeping it was the same and would be the same forever 
as long as he lived: 

And you are ? 

Henry Sutpen. 

Aid you have been here ? 

Four years. 

And you came home ? 

To die. Yes. 

To die? 

Yes. To die. 

And you have been here ? 

Four yem. 

And you are ? 

Henry Sutpen. 

It was quite cold in the room now; the chimes would rir^ 
for one any time now; the chill had a compounded, a 
gathered quality, as though preparing for the dead moment 
before dawn. “And she waited three months before she went 
b^dc to get him,” Shreve said. “Why did she do thatt” 
Quentin Sdn’t answer. He ky still and rigid on his back widi 
the cold New England night on his face and the blood run- 
ning wratm in his rigid body and limbs, breathing hard but 
slow, his eyes Wide open uptm the window, thinking ‘Never- 
more of peace* Nevermore of peace. Nevermore Nevermore; 
Nevermore.’ “Do you suppose it was because she knew what 
was goii^ to happen when she told it, took any a»ps, dwt it 
would be over then, finidb^ and that had®^ is Bite drith ot 

m 



4cugs and she had used it so long that she did not dare risk 
cutting off the supply, destroying the source, the very poppy’s 
root and seed!” Soil Quentin didn’t answer. '‘But at last she 
did reconcile herself to it, for his sake, to save him, to bring 
him into town where the doctors could save him, and so she 
told it then, got the ambulance and the men and went out 
there. And old Clytie maybe watching for just that out of 
the upstairs window for three months now: and maybe even 
your old man W'as right this time and when she saw the am- 
bulance turn into the gate she believed it was (hat same black 
wagon for which she probably had had that nigger boy 
watching for three months now, coming to carry Henry 
into town for the white folks to hang him for shooting 
Charles Bon. And I guess it had been him who had kept that 
dloset under the stairs full of tinder and trash all that time too, 
like she told him to, maybe he not getting it then either but 
keeping it fuH just like she told him, the kerosene and all, for 
three months now, until the hour when he could begin to 

howl Now the chimes began, ringing for one oclocL 

Shreve cea^d, as if he were waiting for them to cease or per- 
haps were even listening to them. Quentin lay still too, as if 
he wem listening too, though he was not; he just heard them 
without listening as he heard Shreve without lis tenin g or 
answering, until they ceased, died away into the icy air deli- 
cate and faint and musical as struck glass. And he, Quentin, 
could see that too, though he had not been there — the am- 
bulance with Miss Coldfield between the driver and the sec- 
ond man, perhaps a deputy sheriff in the duwl surely and 
perhaps even with the umbrella too, though probably no 
hatchet nor flashlight in It now, entering the gate and pithing 
its way gingerly up the rutted and fioren (and np w partially 
thawed) drive; and it may have been the howling or it may 
have been the deputy or the driver or, it may lave been she 
vho cried first: “It’s on fire!” thovgh she would not have 



cried that; she would have said, “Faster. Faster.” leaning for- 
ward on this seat too — the small furious grim implacable 
woman not much larger than a chDd. But die ambulance 
could not go f^t in that drive; doubtless Clytie knew, 
counted upon, that; it would be a good three minutes before 
it could reach the house, the monstrous tinder-dry rotten 
shell seeping smoke through die warped cracks in die 
weather-boarding as if it were made of gauze wire and fUled 
with roaring and beyond which somewhere something 
lurked which bellowed, something human since the bellow- 
ing was in human speech, even though die reason for it 
would not have seemed to be. And the deputy and the driver 
would spring out and Miss Coldfield would stumble out and 
follow them, running too, onto the gallery too, where the 
creature whidh bellowed foEowed ^cm, wraith-hke and 
insubstantial, looking at them out of die smoke, whereupon 
the deputy evoi turned and ran at him, whereupon he re- 
treated, 6ed, though the howling did not diminish nor even 
seem to get any further away. They ran onto the ^llery too, 
into the seeping smoke. Miss Coldfield screaming harshly, 
“The window! The window!” to the second man at the 
door. But the door was not locked; it swung inward; die 
blast of heat struck them. The entire staircase was on fire. 
Yet they had to hold her; Quendn could see it: the ligjit thin 
furious creature making no sound at aE now, struggling with 
silent and bitter fury, dawing and scratching and biting at 
the two men who held her, who dragged her back and down 
the steps as the draft created by the open door seemed to ex- 
plode like powder among the flames as the whole lower haE 
vanished. He, Quentin, could see it, could see the deputy hold- 
ing her while the driver backed the ambulance to safety and 
returned, the three feces aE a Ettlc wfld now since they must 
have believed her— the three of them staring, glaring at tiw: 
doomed house: and diai for a moment maybe Clytie ap- 

375 



peared in that Tvindow from which she must have been 
watching the gates constantly day and night for three 
months — ^the tragic gnome’s face beneath the clean headrag, 
against a red background office, seen for a moment between 
two swirls of smoke, lo’oking dotvn at them, perhaps not 
even now with triumph and no more of despair than it had 
ever worn, possibly even serene above the melting clap- 
boards before the smoke swirled across it again — and he, 
Jim Bond, the sdon, the last of his race, seeing it too now and 
howling with human reason now since now even he could 
have known what he was howling about. But they couldn’t 
catch him. They could hear him; he didn’t seem to ever get 
any further away but they couldn’t get any nearer and maybe 
in time they could not even locate the direction any more of 
the howling. They — the driver and the deputy — ^held Miss 
Coldfield as she struggled: he (Quentin) could see her, them; 
he had not been there but he could see her, struggling and 
fighting like a doll in a nightmare, making no sound, foam- 
ing a little at the mouth, her face even in die sunlight lit by 
one last wild crimson reflection as the house collapsed and 
roared away, and there was only the sound of the idiot negro 
lefL 

"And so it was the Aunt Rosa that came back to town in- 
side the ambulance,’’ Shreve said. Quaxtin did not answer; 
he did not even say, Miss Rosa. He just lay there staring at 
the window without even blinking, breathing the chill heady 
pure sriow^kamed darkness. “And she went to bed because 
it was all fi n ished now, there was nothing left now, nothing 
out there now bitt that idiot boy to lurk around dioa; ashes 
and those four gutted chimneys and howl until someone 
came and drove hun away. They couldn’t catch him and no- 
body ever seemed to nuke him go very fir away, he just 
stopped howling for a little while. UKn after awhile foey 
woidd be^ to hear him again. And so she died.” QtBsntin 



did not answer, staring at the window; then he could not 
tell if it was the actual Taindow or the window’s pale rec- 
tangle upon his eyehds, though after a moment it ^gan to 
emerge. It began to take shape in its same curious, light, 
gravity-defying attitude— the once-folded sheet out of the 
wistaria Mississippi summer, the cigar smell, the random 
blowing of die fireflies, “The South,” Shreve said. “The 
South. Jesus. No wonder you folks all outlive yourselves by 
years and years and years.” It was becoming quite distinct; 
he would be able to decipher the w’ords soon, in a moment; 
even almost now, now, now. 

“I am older at twenty than a lot of people who have died,” 
Quentin said. 

“And more people have died than have been twenty-one,” 
Shreve said. Now he (Quentin) could read it, could finish it 
— ^the sloped whimsical ironic hand out of Mississippi at- 
tenuated, into the iron snow: 

— or perhaps there is. Surety it can harm no one to hetieve that 
perhaps she has escaped not at all the privilege of being outraged 
and amazed and of not forgiving but on the contrary has herself 
gained that place or bourne where the objects of the outrage and of 
the commiseration cdso are no longer ghosts but are actual people to 
be actual recipients of the hatred and the pity. It will do no harm 
to hope — You see I have written hope, not think. So let it be hope, 
— that the one cannot escape the censure which no doubt he deserves, 
that the other no longer lack the commiseration which let us hope 
{while we are hoping) that they have longed for, if only for the 
reason that they are about to receive it whether they will or no. 
The weather was beautifid though cold and they had to use picks 
to break the earth for the grave yet in one of the deeper dods I saw 
a redworm doubtless alive when the dod was throum up though by 
iftemoon it was frozen again. 

“So it took Charles Bon and his mother to get rid of old 
Tom, and Charles Bon and the octoroon to get rid of Judith, 

377 



and Gbarles Bon and Clytie to get rid of Henry; and Cttaries 
Bon s mother and Charles Bon’s grandmother got rid of 
Charles Bon. So it takes two niggers to get rid of one Sut- 
pen, dont ite” Quentin did not answer; evidendy Shreve did 
not want an answer now; he continued almost without a 
pause: “Which is all right, it’s fine; it clears the whole ledger, 
you can tear all the pages out and bum them, except for one 
thing. And do you !mow what that isj” Perhaps he hoped for 
an answer this time, or perhaps he merely paused for empha- 
sis, since he got no answer. “You’ve got one nigger left. One 
nigger Sutpen left. Of course you can’t catch him and you 
don’t even always see him and you never will be able to use 
him. But you’ve got him there still. You still hear him at 
night sometimes. Don’t you?” 

“Yes,” Quentin said. 

“And so do you know what I think?” Now he did expect 
an answer, and now he got one: 

“No,” Quentin said. 

“Do you want to know what I think?” 

“No,” Quentin said. 

“Then I’ll tell you. I think that in time the Jim Bonds are 
going to conquer the western hemisphere. Of course it won’ t 
quite Ite in our time and of course as they spread toward the 
poles they will bleach out again like the rabbits and the birds 
do, so they won’t show up so sharp against the snow. But it 
will still be Jim Bond; and so in a few thousand years, I who 
regard you will also have sprang fiom the loins of Afiican 
kin^. Now I want you to 6^ me just one tiling more. Why 
do you hate the South?” 

“I dont hate it,” Quentin said, quickly, at once, immedi- 
t^y; “I dont hate it,” he said. I dont hate it he thought, pant- 
ing in the cold air, the iron New England dark; I dont. I dont! 
I d^ hate it! I dont hate it!
