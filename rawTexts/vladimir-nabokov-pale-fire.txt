account he gave Mr. Langton, of 
the despicable state of a voung 
gentleman of good family. “Sir, 
v hen I heard of him last, he was 
running about town .shooting

kindly reverie, he bethought him-

said, “Hut, Hodge shan’t be sh&lt; t : 
no, no, Hodge shall nor be shot ” 

JMES BOSWELL, 
the Life of Samuel Johnson 



FOREWORD 


Pale Fire , a poem in heroic couplets, of nine hundred 
ninety-nine lines, divided into four cantos, was composed by 
John Francis Shade during the last twenty days of his life, 
at his residence in New Wye, Appalachia, 1XS.A. 

The manuscript, mostly jl Fair Copy, 
from which the present text has been faithfully printed, 
consists ot eighty medium-sized index cards, on each of which 
Shade reserved the pink upper line for headings (canto num- 
ber, date) and used the fourteen light-blue lines for writing 
out with a fine nib in a minute, tidy, remarkably clear hand, 
the text of his poem, skipping a line to indicate double space* 
and always using a fresh card to begin a new canto. 

The short (166 lines) Canto One, with all those amusing 
birds and parhelia, occupies thirteen cards. Canto Two, your* 
favorite, and that shocking tour de force, Canto Three, are 
identical in length (334 lines) and cover twenty-seven cards 
each. Canto Four reverts to One in length and occupies again 
thirteen cards, of which the last four used on the day of his 
death give a Corrected Draft instead of a Fair Copy. 

A methodical man, John Shade usually copied out his daity 
quota of completed lines at midnight but even if he recopied 
them again later, as I suspect he sometimes did, he marked his 
card or cards not with the date of his final adjustments, but 
with that of his Corrected Draft or first Fair Copy. I mean, 
he preserved the date of actual creation rather than that of 
second or third thoughts. There is a ve*y loud amusement park 
right in front of my present lodgings. v 
We possess in result a complete calendar of his work. Canto 
One was begun in the small hours of July 2 and completed on 
July 4, He started the next canto on his birthday and finished 
it on July 11. Another week was devoted to Canto Three.

FALE FIRE 


Canto Four was begun on July 19, and as aheady noted, the 
last third of its text (lines 949-999) is supplied by a Cor- 
rected Draft. This is extremely rough in appearance, teeming 
with devasting erasures and cataclysmic insertions, and does 
not follow the lines of the card as rigidly as the Fair Copy 
does. Actually, it turns out to be beautifully accurate when 
you once make the plunge *nd compel yourself to open your 
eyes m the limpid depths under its contused surface. It con- 
tains not one gappy line, not one doubtful reading. This fact 
would be sufficient to show that the imputations made (on 
July 24) m a newspaper interview with one of our 
professed Shadeans — who affirmed without having seen the 
manuscript of the poem that it “consists of disjointed drafts 
none of which yields a definite text'’ — is a malicious invention 
on the part of those who would wish not so much to deplore 
the state in which a great poet’s work w u interrupted by death 
as to asperse the competence, and perhaps honesty, oi its 
present editor and commentator. 

Another pronouncement publicly made by Prot. lluiley 
and his clique refers to a structural matter. ! quote lrom the 
same interview: “None can say how long John Shade planned 
bis poem to be, but it i* not improbable that what he left 
represents only a small fraction ot the composition he saw in 
a glass, darkly.” Nonsense again! Aside from the veritable 
clarion of internal csidence ringing throughout Canto hour, 
there exists Svbil Shade’s affirmation (in a document dated 
July 25 ) that her husband % never intended to go be- 
yond four parts.” Tor him the third canto was the penultimate 
one, and thus I myself have heard him speak of it, in the 
course of a sunset ramble, when, as if thinking aloud, he re- 
viewed the day’s work and gesticulated m pardonable seif- 
approbation while his discreet companion kept trying in vain 
to adapt the swing of a long-limbed gait to the disheveled old 
poet’s jerky shuffle. Nay, I shall even assert (a? our shadows 
still Walk without us) that there remained to be written only 
one line of the poem (namely verse 1000) which would have 
been identical to line 1 and would have completed the sym- 
metry of the structure, with its two identical central parts, solid 
and ample, forming together with the shorter flanks twin wings 
of five hundred verses each, and damn that music. Knowing 
Shade’s combinational turn of mind and subtle sense of har- 
monic balance, I cannot imagine that he intended to deform

the faces of his crystal by meddling with its predictable growth. 
And if all this were not enough — and it is, it is enough — I 
have had the dramatic occasion of hearing my poor friend's 
own voice proclaim on the evening of July 21 the end, or 
almost the end, of his labors. (See my note to line 991.) 

This batch of eighty cards was held by a rubber band which 
I now religiously put back after examining for the last time 
their precious contents. Another, much thinner, set of a dozen 
cards, clipped together and enclosed in the same manila en- 
velope as the main batch, bears some additional couplets run- 
ning their brief and sometimes smudgy course among a chaos 
of first drafts. As a rule. Shade destroyed drafts the moment 
he ceased to need them: well do I recall seeing him from my 
porch, on a brilliant morning, burning a whole stack of them 
in the pale fire oi the incinerator before which be stood with 
bent head like an official mourner among the winc^baroe 
black butterflies of that backyard auto-da-f6 But he saved 
those twelve cards because of the unused felicities shining 
among the dross of used diaf tings. Perhaps, he vaguely ex- 
pected to rcpl ice certain passages in the Fair Copy with some 
of the lovely rejections in his files, or, more probably, a 
sneaking fondness for this or that vignette, suppressed out of 
atchilcctomc considerations, or because it had annoyed Mrs. 
S., urged him to put off its disposal till the time when the 
marble finality of an immaculate typescript would have con- 
firmed it or made the most delightful variant seem cumber- 
some and impure. And perhaps, let me pdd m all modesty, he 
intended to ask my advice after reading bis poem to me as I 
know he planned to do. 

In my notes to the poem the reader will find these canceled 
readings. Their places are indicated, or at least suggested, by 
the draftings of established lines in their immediate neighbor- 
hood. In a sense, many oi them are more valuable artistically 
and historically than some of the best passages m the find 
text. 1 must now explain how Pale Fire came to be edited by 
me. 

Immediately after my dear friend's death I prevailed on his 
distraught widow to forelay and defeat the commercial pas- 
sions and academic intrigues that were bound to come swirling 
around her husband’s manuscript (transferred by me to a safe 
spot even before his body had reached the grave) by signing 
an agreement to the effect that he had turned over the manu-

script to me; that I would have it published without delay, 
with my commentary, by a firm of my choice; that all profits, 
except the publisher’s percentage, would accrue to her; and 
that on publication day the manuscript would be handed over 
to the Library of Congress for permanent preservation. I defy 
any serious critic to find this contract unfair. Nevertheless, it 
has been called (by Shaded former lawyer) “a fantastic far- 
rago of evil,” while another person (his former literary agent’) 
has wondered with a sneer if Mrs. Shade’s tremulous signature 
might not have been penned “in some peculiar kind of red 
ink” Such hearts, such brains, would be unable to compre- 
hend that one’s attachment to a masterpiece may be utterly 
overwhelming, especially when it is the underside of the weave 
that entrances the beholder and only begetter, whose own past 
intercoils there with the fate of the innocent author. 

As mentioned, I think, in my last note to the poem, the 
depth charge of Shade’s death blasted such secrets and caused 
so many dead fish to float up, that I was forced to leave New 
Wye soon after my last interview with the jailed killer. The 
writing of the commentary had to be postponed until I could 
find a new incognito in quieter surroundings, but practical mat- 
ters concerning the poem had to be settled at once. I took a 
plane to New York, had the manuscript photographed, came 
to terms with one of Shade’s publishers, and was on the point 
of clinching the deal when, quite casually, in the midst of a 
vast sunset (we sat in a cell of walnut and glass fifty stories 
above the progression of scarabs), my interlocutor observed: 
“You’ll be happy to know, Dr. Kinbote, that Professor So- 
and-so [one of the members of the Shade committee] has con- 
sented to act as our adviser in editing the stuff.” 

Now “happy” is something extremely subjective. One of 
our sillier Zemblan proverbs says: the lost glove is happy . 
Promptly I refastened the catch of my briefcase and betook 
myself to another publisher. 

Imagine a soft, clumsy giant; imagine a historical personage 
whose knowledge of money is limited to the abstract billions of 
B national debt; imagine an exiled prince who is unaware of 
Che Golconda in his cuff links! This is to say — oh, hyperbol- 
ically— that I am the most impractical fellow in the world. 
Between such a person and an old fox in the book publishing 
business, relations are at first touchingly carefree and chummy/ 
!witfa expansive banterings and all sorts of amiable tokens. I

have no reason to suppose that anything will ever happen to 
prevent this initial relationship with good old Frank, my 
present publisher, from remaining a permanent fixture. 

Frank has acknowledged the safe return of the galleys 1 
had been sent here and has asked me to mention in my Preface 
— and this I willingly do — that I alone am responsible for any 
mistakes in my commentary. Insert before a professional. A 
professional proofreader has carefully recheckcd the printed 
text of the poem against the phototype of the manuscript, and 
has found a few trivial misprints 1 had missed; that has been 
all in the way of outside assistance. Needless to say bow much 
1 had been looking forward to Sybil Shade’s providing me with 
abundant biographical data; unfortunately she left New Wye 
even before I did, and is dwelling now with relatives in Que- 
bec. We might have had, of course, a most fruitful correspond- 
ence, but the Sfaadeans were not to be shaken oft. They headed 
lor Canada in droves to pounce on the poor lady as soon as I 
had lost contact with her and her changeful moods. Instead of 
answering a month-old letter from my cave in Cedarn, listing 
some ot m&gt; most desperate queries, such as the real name of 
“Jim Coates’' etc., site suddenly shot me a wire, requesting me 
to accept Prof. H. (!) and Prof. C. (1!) as co-editors of her 
husband's poem. How deep!) this surprised and pained me! 
Naturally, it precluded collaboration with my friend’s inis* 
guided widow. 

And he wa« a ven dear triend indeed! The calendar says I 
had known him only for a few months but there exist friend- 
ships which develop their own inner duration, their own eons 
ot transparent time, independent of rotating, malicious music. 
Never shall I forget how elated I was upon learning, as men- 
tioned in a note mv reader shall find, that the suburban house 
(rented for my use from Judge Goldsworth who had gone on 
his Sabbatical ro England) into which J moved on February 5, 
stood next to rhat of the celebrated American poet whose 
verses I had tried to pul into Zemblan two decades earlier! 
Apart from this glamorous neighborhood, the Goldsworthian 
chateau, as I was soon to discover, had little to recommend 
it. The heating system was a farce, depending as it did on 
registers in the floor wherefrom the tepid exhalations of a 
throbbing and groaning basement furnace were transmitted to 
the rooms with the faintness of a moribund’s List breath. By 
occluding the apertures upstairs I attempted to give mote

energy to the register m the living room but its climate proved 
to be incurably vitiated by there being nothing between it 
and the arctic regions save a sleezy front door without a ves- 
tige of vestibule — either because the house had been built 
m midsummer by a naive settler who could not imagine the 
kind of winter New Wye had in stoie for him, or because 
oldtime gentility required that a chance caller at the open 
door could satisfy himself from the threshold that nothing 
unseemly was going on m the parlor 

February and March tn Zembla (the two last of the tour 
“white-nosed months,” as we call them) used to bo pretty 
rough too, but even a peasant’s room there presented a solid 
of uniform warmth — not a reticulation of deadly dratts Tt

preparing to leave for college iu the po a eil li red car I had 
just acquired, I noticed that Mr md Mr Sh ide, neither of

their old Packard m the slippery duvtw where it emitted 
whines of agony but could not o\trioatt one tortmed rear

himself clumsily with a bucket lrom which, with the gestures 
of a sower, he distributed nandluls oJ brown and over the

he had been ill a few months before, and thinking to offer 
my neighbors a ride to the campus in my powerful machine, 
I hurried out toward them A lane uirvtng ground the slight 
eminence on which my rented castle stood separated it from 
my neighbors’ driveway, and I was about to cross that lane 
when I lost my footing and sat down on the surpusingly hard 
snow. My fall acted as a chemical reagent on the Shades’ 
sedan, which forthwith budged and ilmos f ran over me as 
it swung into the lane with John at tne whe*l strenuously

or five other eminent professors at his usual table, under an 
enlarged photograph of Wordsmith College as it was, stunned 
and shabby, on a remarkably gloomy summer day in 1903. 

His laconic suggestion that I “try the pork” amused me. I 

am a strict vegetarian, and I like to cook my own meals. 

Consuming something that had been handled by a fellow 

creature was, I explained to the rubicund convives, as re- 
pulsive to me as eating any creature, and that would include— 
lowering my voice — the pulpous pony-tailed girl student who 
served us and licked her pencil. Moreover, I had already 
finished the fruit brought with me in my briefcase, so I would 
content myself, I said, with a bottle of good college ale. My 
free and simple demeanor set everybody at ease. The usual 
questions were fired a* me about eggnogs and milkshakes be- 
ing or not being acceptable to one of my persuasion. Shade 
said that with him it was the other way around: he must 
make a definite effort to partake of a vegetable. Beginning 
a salad, vias to him hkc stepping into sea water on a chilly 
day, and he had always to brace himself in order tp attack 
the fortress ot an apple. I was not yet used to the rather 
fatiguing jesting and teasing that goes on among American 
intellectuals of the inbreeding academic type and so abstained 
from telling John Shade in fiont of all those grinning o(d 
males how T much I admired his work lest a senous discussion 
of literature degenerate into mere facctiation. Instead I asked 
him about one of my newly acquired students who also at- 
tended his course, a moody, delicate, rather wonderful boy; 
but with a resolute shake of his hoary forelock the old poet 
answered that he had ceased long ago to memorize faces and 
names of students and that the only person in his poetry class 
whom he could visualize was an extramural lady on crutches. 
“Come, come,” said Prolessor Hurley, “do you mean, John, 
you really don’t have a mental or visceral picture of that 
stunning blonde in the black leotard who haunts Lit. 202?’ 
Shade, all his wrinkles beaming, benignly tapped Hurley on 
the wrist to make him stop. Another tormentor inquired if it 
was true that 1 had installed twx&gt; ping-pong tables in my base- 
ment. I asked, was it a crime? No, ne said, but why two? 
“Is that a crime?” I countered, and they all laughed. 

Despite a wobbly heart (see line 735), a slight limp, and 
a certain curious contortion in his method of progress. Shade 
had an inordinate liking for long walks, but the snow bothered

him, and he prefci red, in winter, to have his wife call for him 
after classes with the car. A few days later, as 1 was about 
to leave Parthenocissus Hall — or Main Hall (or now Shade 
Hall, alas), 1 saw him waiting outside for Mrs. Shade to fetch 
him. I stood beside him for a minute, on the steps of the pil- 
lared porch, while pulling my gloves on, finger by finger, and 
looking away, as if waiting to review a regiment : “That was 
a thorough job,” commented the poet He consulted his wrist 
watch. A snowflake settled upon it. “Crystal to crystal,” said 
Shade. I offered to take him home in my powerful Kramler. 
“Wives, Mr. Shade, arc forgetful.” He cocked his shaggy 
head to look at the library clock. Across the bleak expanse 
of snow-covered turt two radiant lads m colorful winter clothes 
passed, laughing and sliding. Shade glanced at his w dch again 
and, with a shrug, accepted my offer. 

T wanted to know if he did not ramd being taken the longer 
way, with a stop at Community Center wheit 1 wanted to buy 
some chocolate -coated cookies and a litth caviar. He said it 
was fine with him. From the ms*de of the supermarket, 
through a plate-glass window, I the old chip pop into 
a liquor store. When I returned wah mv purchases, he way 
back in the car, reading a tabloid newspaper which I bad 
thought no pi&gt;et would d«*ign to touch A comfortable burp 
told me he had a flask of brandy concealed about his warmly 
coated person As we turned into the di ivew )y of his house, 
we &amp;aw Sybil pulling up m front of il I &lt;&gt;ot out with courteous 
vivacity. She said: “Since my husband does not believe in 
introducing people, let us do it oiu selves: You are Dr. 
Kinbote, aren’t you 7 And l am S\bit vShade ” ihen she ad- 
dressed her husband saying he might havt waited in his office 
another minute: she had honked and tolled, and walked all 
the way up, et cetera. I turned to go, not wishing to listen 
to a marital scene, but she called me back: “Have a drink 
with us,” she said, “or rather with me, because Tohn is for- 
bidden to touch alct hoi.” 1 explained I could not stay long 
as T was about to have a kind of little seminar at home fol- 
lowed by some table tennis, with two charming identical twins 
and another boy, another boy. 

Henceforth 1 began seeing more and more of my celebrated 
neighbor. The view irom one of my windows kept providing 
me with first-rate entertainment, especially when I was on 
the wait for some tardy guest. From the second story of my

house the Shades* living-room window remained clearly visible 
so long as the branches of the deciduous trees between us 
were still bare, and almost every evening I could see the 
poet’s slippered foot gently rocking. One inferred from it that 
he was sitting with a book in a low chair but one never man- 
aged to glimpse more than that foot and its shadow moving 
up and down to tbe secret rhythm ot menial absorption, in 
the concentrated lamplight. Always at the same time the 
brown morocco slipper would drop from the wool-socked foot 
which continued to oscillate, with, however, a slight slacken- 
ing of pace. One knew that bedtime was clo&amp;mg in with all 
its terrois, that in a few minutes the toe would prod and 
woiry the slipper, and then disappear with it from my golden 
field of vision traversed by the black bendlet of a branch. 
And sometimes Sybil Shade would trip by with the velocity 
and swinging aims ot one flouncing out m a fit of temper, 
and world return a little later at a much slower g^it, having, 
as it were, pardoned hei husband for his friendship with an 
eccenuiw neighbor, but the uddle of her behavior was entirely 
solved one night when b\ dialing their number and watching 
their window at the same time I magically induced her to go 
through the hasty and quite innocent motions that had puz- 
zled me. 

Alas, my peace of mind was soon to be shattered. The 
thick venom of enw began squirting at me as soon as aca- 
demic suburbia ieah/ed that John Shade valued my society 
above that of all other people Yoi.r snicker. my dear Mrs. C., 
did not escape our notice as I was helping the tired old poet 
to find his galoshes alter that dreary get-together party at 
your house. One day I happened to enter the English litera- 
ture office in quest of a magazine with the picture of the 
Royal Palace m Onhava, which I wanted inv friend to see, 
when I overheard a young instructor m a green velvet jacket, 
whom I shall mercifully call Gerald Fmerald, carelessly say- 
ing m answer to something tbe secretary had asked: “1 guess 
Mr. Shade has already left with the Great Beave*.” Of course, 
I am quite tall, and my brown beard is of a rather rich tint 
and texture; the silly cognomen evidently applied to me, but 
was not worth noticing, and after calmly talung the magazine 
from a pamphlet-cluttered table, I contented myself on my 
way out with pulling Gerald Emeralds bowtie loose with a 
deft jerk of my fingers as I passed by him. There was also

the morning when Dr. Nattochdag, head of the department 
to which 1 was attached, begged me in a formal voice to be 
seated, then closed the door, and having regained, with a 
downcast frown, his swivel chair, urged me “to he more care- 
ful. 1 * In what sense, careful? A boy had complained to his 
adviser. Complained of what, good I ord? That I had criti- 
cized a literature course he attended (“a ridiculous survey of 
ridiculous works, conducted by a ridiculous mediocrity”)* 
Laughing in sheer relief, I embraced my good Neiochka, tell- 
ing him I would never be naughty again I take this oppor- 
tunity to salute him. He always bcha\ ed with such exquisite 
courtesy toward me that I sometimes wondered if he did not 
suspect what Shade suspected, and what only three people 
(two trustees and the president of the college) definitely knew. 

Oh, there were many such incidents. In a skit performed 
by a group of drama students I was pictured as a pompous 
woman hater with a German accent, constantly quoting Hem- 
man and nibbling raw carrots; and a week before Shade’s 
death, a certain ferocious lady at whose club 1 had refused 
to speak on the subject of “The Hally Villv” (as she put it, 
confusing Odin’s Hall with the title of a Finnish epic), said 
to me in the middle of a grocery stoie, “You are a remark- 
ably disagreeable person. 1 fail to see how Tohn and Sybil 
can stand you,” and, exasperated by mv polite smile, she 
added: “What’s mote, you are insane.” 

But let me not pursue the tabulation of nonsense. What- 
ever was thought, whatever was said, l had ray full reward 
in John’s friendship. This friendship was the more precious 
tor its tenderness being intentionally concealed, especially 
when we were not alone, by that gruffness which stems from 
what can be termed the dignity of the heart. His whole being 
constituted a mask. John Shade’s physical appearance was 
so little in keeping with the harmonies hiving in the man, 
that one felt inclined to dismiss it as a coarse disguise or 
passing fashion; for if the fashions of the Romantic Age sub- 
tilized a poet’s manliness by baring his attractive neck, prun- 
ing his profile 'rad reflecting a mountain lake in his oval 
gaze, present-day bards, owing perhaps to better opportunities 
of aging, look like gorillas or vultures. My sublime neighbor’s 
face had something about it that might have appealed to the 
eye, *had it been only leonine or only Iroquoiatr, but un- 
fortunately, by combining the two it merely reminded one of

a fleshy Hogarthian tippler of indeterminate sex. His mis- 
shapen body* that gray mop of abundant hair, the yellow 
nails of his pudgy fingers, the bags under his lusterless eyes, 
were only intelligible if regarded as the waste products elimi- 
nated from his intrinsic self by the same forces of perfection 
which purified and chiseled his veise. He was his own cancel- 
lation. 

I have one favorite photograph of him In this color snap- 
shot taken by a onetime triend ot mine, on a brilliant spring 
day, Shade is seen leaning on a sturdy cane that had belonged 
to his aunt Maud (see line 86). 1 am wearing a white wind*- 
breaker acquired in a local sports shop and a pair of lilac 
slacks hailing from Cannes. My left hand is half raised — not 
to pat Shade on the shoulder as seems to be the intention, 
but to remove my sunglasses which, however, it never reached 
tn that life, the life of the picture; and the library book under 
my right arm is a tieatise on certun Zemblan calisthedfcs in 
which 1 proposed to interest that young roomer of mine wbo 
^napped the picture. A week later he was to betray my trust 
by taking sordid advantage of mv absence on a trip to Wash- 
ington whence 1 returned to find he had been entertaining 
a tiery-haircd whore from Fxton who had left her combings 
and reck in all three bathrooms. Naturally, we separated at 
once, and through a chink m the window curtains I sad bad 
Rob standing rather pathetically, with his crew cut, and shabby 
valise, and the skis I had given him, all forlorn on the road- 
side, waiting for a fellow student to drive him away forever. 
I can forgive everything save ticason. 

We never discussed, John Shade and l, any of ray personal 
misfortunes. Our ch&gt;e friendship was on that higher, exclu- 
sively intellectual level where one rest from emotional 
troubles, not share them. My admiration lor bun was ior me 
a sort of alpine cure. I experienced a grand sense of wonder 
whenever I looked at him, especially in the presence of other 
people, inferior people. This wonder was enhanced by mv 
awareness of their not tecling what 1 felt, of their not seeing 
what 1 saw, of their taking Shade for granted, instead of 
drenching every nerve, so to speak, in the lomance of his 
presence. Here he is, 1 would say to mvself, that is his head, 
containing a brain of a different brand than that of the syn- 
thetic jellies preserved in the skulls around him. He is look-

evening) at the distant Jake I am looking at him I am wit- 
nessing a unique physiological phenomenon John Shade per- 
ceiving and transforming the world, taking it in and taking 
it apart, re-combining its elements m the very process of 
storing them up so as to produce at some unspecified date 
an organic miracle, a fusion of image and music, a line of 
verse. And I experienced the same thrill is when m my early 
boyhood I once watched across the tea table m m&gt; uncle’s 
castle a conjurer who had just given a fantastic performance 
and was now quietly consuming a vanilla icc 1 stued at his 
powdered cheeks, at tne magical flower m ht&gt; buttonhole 
where it had passed through a succession of different colors 
and had now become fixed as a while e irnation and espe- 
cially at his marvelous fluid-look mg fingers which could if 
he chose make bis spoon dissolve into a sunbeam by twid- 
dling it, or turn his rhlc into a dove b tossing it up in the 
air 

Shade’s poem is indeed, that sudden flournh of magn * 
my gray-haned friend, trv beio\ed old conjurer, pul a pack 
of index cards into his hat— and shook out a pown

and reticent for an autobiographical work), with the omis-

An indoor scene, hickory leaves, the svelte 
Stilettos of a frozen stillicide — 

Was printed on my eyelids' nether side 
Where it would tarry for an hour or two. 

And while this lasted all I had to do 
Was close my eyes to reproduce the leaves, 

40 Or indoorscene, or trophies of the caves. 

I cannot understand why from the lake 
I could make out our front porch when Pd take 
Lake Road to school, whilst now, although no tree 
Has intervened, 1 look but fail to see 
Even the roof. Maybe some quirk in space 
Has caused a fold or furrow to displace 
The fragile vista, the frame house between 
Goldsworih and Wordsmith on its square of green. 

I had a favorite young shagbark there 
*° With ample dark jade leaves and a Mack, space, 
Vermiculatcd trunk. The setting sun 
Bronzed the black bark, around which, like undone 
Garlands, the shadows of the foliage fell. 

It is now stout and rough; it has done well. 

White butterflies turn lavender as they 

Pass through its shade where gently seems to sway 

The phantom of my little daughter’s swing. 

The house itself is much the same. One wing 
We’ve had revamped. There’s a solarium. There’s 
40 A picture window flanked with fancy chairs. 

TV’s huge paperclip now shines instead 
Of the stiff vane so often visited 
By the naive, the gauzy mockingbird 
Retelling ail the programs she had heard; 

Switching from chippo-chippo to a clear 
To-wee t to-wee; then rasping out: come here , 
Come here , come herrr V flirting her tail aloft, 

Or gracefully indulging in a soft

The iridule — when, beautiful and strange, 

110 In a bright sky above a mountain range 
One opal cloudlet in an oval form 
Reflects the rainbow of a thunderstorm 
Which in a distant valley has been staged — 

For we are most artistically caged. 

And there’s the wall of sound ; the nightly wall 
Raised by a trillion crickets in the fail. 
Impenetrable! Halfway up the hill 
I’d pause in thrall of their delirious trill. 

That’s Dr. Sutton’s light. That’s the Great Bear. 
120 A thousand years ago five minutes were 
Equal to forty ounces of fine sand. 

Outstare the stars. Infinite foretime and 

Infinite aftertime: above your head 

They close like giant wings, and you arc dead. 

The regular vulgarian, 1 daresay. 

Is happier: he secs the Milky Way 
Only when making water. Then as now 
I walked at my own risk: whipped by the bough. 
Tripped by the stump. Asthmatic, lame and fat, 
130 I never bounced a ball or swung a bat. 

I was the shadow of the waxwing slain 
By feigned remoteness in the windowpane. 

I had a brain, five senses (one unique), 

But otherwise 1 was a eloutish freak. 

In sleeping dreams I played with other chaps 
But really envied nothing — save perhaps 
The miracle of a lemniscate left 
Upon wet sand by nonchalantly deft 
Bicycle tires. 

A thread of subtle pain, 

140 Tugged at by playful death, released again. 

But always present, ran through me. One day. 
When I’d just turned eleven, as I lay 
Prone on the floor and watched a clockwork toy- 
A tin wheelbarrow pushed by a tin boy — 

” Bypass chair legs and stray beneath the bed. 
There was a sudden sunburst in my head.

And then black night. That blackness was sublime. 
I felt distributed through space and time: 

One foot upon a mountaintop, one hand 
360 Undei the pebbles of a panting strand, 

One ear m Italy, one eye in Spain, 

In caves, my blood, and in the stars, my brain. 
There were dull throbs in my Triassic, green 
Optical spots m Upper Pleistocene, 

And icy shiver down my Age of Slone, 

And all tomorrows in my funnybone. 

During one winter every afternoon 
I'd sink into that momentary swoon 
And then it ceased Its memory grew dim. 
if»o My health improved I even learned to swim. 

But like some little lad lorced by a wench 
With his pure tongue her abject thirst to quench, 

I was corrupted, tenihed, allured. 

And though old doctor Coll pronounced me cured 
wh it he n ud, v e;t mainly growing p »ras 
The wonder ling *rs and the shame remains.

In April’s haze immediately behind 
Your slender back and watched your neat small head 
Bend to one side. One palm with fingers spread. 
Between a star of trillium and a stone. 

Pressed on the turf. A little phalange bone 
Kept twitching. Then you turned and offered me 
280 A thimbleful of bright metallic tea. 

Your profile has not changed. The glistening teeth 
Biting the careful lip; the shade beneath 
The eye from the long lashes; the peach down 
Rimming the cheekbone; the dark silky biown 
Of hair brushed up from temple and from nape; 

The very naked neck; the Persian shape 
Of nose and eyebrow, you have kept it all — 

And on still nights we hear the waterfall. 

Come and be worshiped, come and be caressed, 

S70 jyfy djy-fc Vanessa, crimson-barred, im blest 
My Admirable butterflyl Explain 
How could you, in the gloam of Lilac 1 ane, 

Have let uncouth, h^ sterical John Shade 
Blubber your face, and ear and shoukkr hladu? 

We have been married forty years At le ist 
Four thousand times ) our pillow h is been creased 
By our two heads Four hundred thousand titm s 
The tall clock with the hoarse Westminster Llnmcs 
Has marked our common hour. How many moie 
280 Free calendars shall grace the kitchen door? 

I love you when you’re standing on the lawn 
Peering at something in a tree: “It’s gone. 

It was so small. It might come ba.k” (all this 
Voiced m a whisper softer than a kiss). 

I love you when you call me to admire 
A jet’s pink trail above the sunset fire. 

I love you when you’re humming as you pack 
A suitcase or the farcical car sack 
With round-trip zipper. And I love you most 
280 When with a pensive nod you greet her ghost 
And hold her first toy on your palm, or look 
At a postcard from her, found in a book. 



She might have been you, me, or some quaint blend: 
Nature chose me so as to wrench and rend 
Your heart and mine. At first we’d smile and say: 
“All little girls are plump” or “Jim McVey 
(The family oculist) will cure that slight 
Squint in no time/’ And later: “She’ll be quite 
Pretty, you know”; and, trying to assuage 
The swelling torment: “That’s the awkward age/* 
“She should take riding lessons,” you would say 
(Your eyes and mine not meeting). “She should play 
Tennis, or badminton. Less starch, more fruit! 

She may not be a beauty, but she’s cute.” 

It was no use, no use. The prizes won 
In French and history, no doubt, were fun; 

At Christmas parties games were rough, no doubi. 
And one shy little guest might be left out; 

But Jet’s be fair: while children of her age 
Were cast as elves and fairies on the stage 
That \he‘d helped paint fot the school pantomime, 
My gentle girl appeared as Mother Time, 

A bent charwoman with slop pail and broom. 

And like a tool 1 sobbed in the men’s room. 

Another w inter was scrape-scooped away. 

The Toothwort White haunted our woods in May. 
Summer was power-mowed, and autumn, burned. 
Alas, the dingy cygnet never turned 
Into a wood duck. And again your voice: 

“But this is prejudice! You should rejoice 
That she is innocent. Why overstress 
The physical? She w ant r to look a mess. 

Virgins have written some resplendent books. 
Lovemakmg is not everything. Good looks 
Are not that indispensable!” And still 
Old Pan would call from every painted hill. 

And still the demons of our pity spoke: 

No lips would share the lipstick of her smoke: 

The telephone that rang before a ball 
Every two minutes in Sorosa Hall 
For her would never ring; and, with a great 
Screeching of tires on gravel, to the gate

Out of the lacquered night, a white-scarfed beau 
Would never come for her; she’d never go, 

A dream of gauze and jasmine, to that dance. 

We sent her, though, to a chateau in France, 

And she returned in tears, with new defeats. 

New miseries. On days when all the streets 
Of College Town led to the game, she’d sit 
840 On the library steps, and read or knit; 

Mostly alone she’d be, or with that nice 
Frail roommate, now a nun; and, once or twice, 

With a Korean boy who took my course. 

She had strange fears, strange fantasies, strange force 
Of character — as when she spent three nights 
Investigating certain sounds and lights 
In an old barn. She twisted words: pot, top. 

Spider, redips. And “powder” was “red wop.” 

She called you a didactic katydid. 

360 She hardly ever smiled, and when she did. 

It was a sign of pain. She’d criticize 
Ferociously our projects, and with eyes 
Expressionless sit on her tumbled bed 
Spreading her swollen feet, scratching her hcaa 
With psoriatic fingernails, and moan. 

Murmuring dreadful words in monotone. 

She was my darling: difficult, morose — 

But still my darling. You remember those 
Almost unruffied evenings when we played 
sec Mah-jongg, or she tried on your furs, which made 
JHer almost fetching; and the mirrors smiled. 

The lights were mcreilui, the shadows mild. 

Sometimes I’d help her with a Latin text. 

Or she’d be reading in her bedroom, next 
To my fluorescent lair, and you would be 
In your own study, twice removed from me, 

And I would hear both voices now and then: 

“Mother, what’s grimpen?” “What is what?” 

“Grim Pen .* 1 

Pause, and your guarded scholium. Then again: 

370 “Mother, what’s chtonic?" That, too, you’d explain, 
Appending: “Would you like a tangerine?”

“No. Yes. And what does sempiternal mean?” 

You’d hesitate. And lustily I’d roar 

The answer from my desk through the closed door* 

It does not matter what it was she read 
(some phony modern poem that was said 
In English Lit to be a document 
“Engazhay and compelling’* — what this meant 
Nobody cared) ; the point is that the three 
a80 Chambers, then bound by you and her and me, 
Now from a tryptich or a three-act play 
In which portrayed events forever stay. 

I think she always nursed a small mad hope. 

I’d finished recently my book on Pope. 

Jane Dean, my typist, offered her one day 
To meet Pete Dean, a cousin. Janes fiance 
Would then take all of them in his new car 
A score of miles to a Hawaiian bar. 

The boy was picked up at a quarter past 
3»o Eight in New Wye. Sleet glazed the roads. At last 
They tound the place — when suddenly Pete Dean 
Clutching his brow exclaimed that he had dean 
Forgotten an appointment with a chum 
Who’d land in jail if he, Pete, did not come, 

Et cetera. She said she understood. 

After he’d gone the three young people stood 
Before the azure entrance for awhile. 

Puddles were neon-barred; and with a smile 
She said she’d be de trop, she’d much prefer 
400 Just going home. Her friends escorted her 
To the bus stop and left; but she, instead 
Of riding home, got off at Lochanhead. 

You scrutinized your wrist: “It’s eight fifteen. 

[And here time forked.] I’ll turn it on.” The screen 
In its blank broth evolved a lifelike blur, 

And music welled. 

He took one look at her , 

And shot a death ray at well-meaning Jane *

Clashed queerly with the sea, and two were red),

The crowding gulls insufferably loud. 

And one dark pigeon waddling in the crowd. 

“Was that the phone?” You listened at the door. 
Nothing. Picked up the program from the floor. 
More headlights in the fog . There was no sense 
In window-rubbing: only some white fence 
And the reflector poles passed by unmasked.

“Are we quite sure she’s acting right?” you asked* 
“It's technically a blind date, of course. 

450 Well, shall we try the preview of Remorse ?” 

And we allowed, in all tranquillity, 

The famous film to spread its charmed marquee; 
The famous face flowed in, fair and inane: 

The parted lips, the swimming eyes, the grain 
Of beauty on the cheek, odd gallicism, 

And the soft form dissolving in the prism 
Of corporate desire.

Out of his lakeside shack 
A watchman , Father Time , all gray and bent, 
Emerged with his uneasy dog and went 
Along the reedy bank. He came too late. 

You gently yawned and stacked away your plate. 

We heard the wind. We heard it rush and throw 
Twigs at the windowpane. Phone ringing? No.

Kept on demolishing young root, old rock. 

“Midnight,” you said. What’s midnight to the young?

At Lochan Neck where zesty skaters crossed 
4W&gt; From Exe to Wye on days of special frost. 

Others supposed she might have lost her way 
By turning left from Bridgeroad; and some say 
She took her poor young life. X know. You know. 

It was a night of thaw, a night of blow. 

With great excitement in the air. Black spring 
Stood just around the corner, shivering 
In the wet starlight and on the wet ground. 

The lake lay in the mist, its ice half drowned. 

A blurry shape stepped off the reedy bank

Was a larvorium and a violet: 

A grave in Reason’s early spring. And yet 
It missed the gist of the whole thing; it missed 
What mostly interests the preterist; 

For we die every day; oblivion thrives 
Not on dry thighbones but on blood-ripe lives. 

And our best yesterdays are now foul piles 
Of crumpled names, phone numbers and toxed files. 
I’m ready to become a floweret 
Or a fat fly, but never, to forget. 

And 1*11 turn down eternity unless 
The melancholy and the tenderness 
Of mortal life; the passion and the pain; 

The claret taillight of that dwindling plane 
Off Hesperus; your gesture ot dismay 
On running out of cigarettes; the way 
You smile at dogs; the trail of silver slime 
Snails leave or flagstones; this good ink, this rhyme. 
This index card, this slender rubber band 
Which always forms, when dropped, an ampersand, 
Are found in Heaven by the newlydead 
Stored in its strongholds through the years. 

Instead 

The Institute assumed it might be wise 
Not to expect too much of paradise: 

Whal if there’s nobody to say hullo 
To the newcomer, no reception, no 
Indoctrination? What if you are tossed 
Into a boundless void, your bearings lost, 

Your spirit stripped and utterly alone. 

Your task unfinished, your despair unknown, 

Your body just beginning to putresce, 

A non-undressable m morning dress. 

Your widow lying prone on a dim bed, 

Herself a blur in your dissolving head!

How to locate in blackness, with a gasp,

How to keep sane in spiral types of space. 
Precautions to be taken in the case 
Of freak reincarnation: what to do 
On suddenly discovering that you 
Are now a young and vulnerable toad 
Plump in the middle of a busy road. 

Or a bear cub beneath a burning pine. 

Or a book mite in a revived divine. 

Time means succession, and succession, change: 
Hence timelessness is bound to disarrange 
Schedules of sentiment. We give advice 
570 To widower. He has been married twice : 

He meets his wives; both loved, both loving, both 
Jealous of one another. Time means growth. 

And growth means nothing in Elysian life. 
Fondling a changeless child, the flax-haired w ife 
Grieves on the brink of a remembered pond 
Full of a dreamy sky. And, also blond. 

But with a touch of tawnv in the shade, 

Feet up, knees clasped, on a stone balustrade

580 Toward the blue impenetrable haze. 

How to begin? Which first to kiss? What toy 
To give the babe? Does that small solemn boy 
Know of the head-on crash which on a wild 
March night killed both the mother and the child? 
And she, the second love, with instep bare 
In ballerina black, why does she wear 
The earrings from the other’s jewel case? 

And why does she avert her fierce young face? 

For as we know from dreams it is so hard 
880 To speak to our dear dead! They disregard 
Our apprehension, queaziness and shame — 

The awful sense that they’re not quite the same. 
And our school chum killed in a distant war 
Is not surprised to see us at his door.

And in a blend of jauntiness and gloom 
Points at the puddles in his basement room. 

But who can teach the thoughts we should roll-call 
When morning finds us marching to the wall 
Under the stage direction of some goon 
600 Political, some uniformed baboon? 

We’ll think of matters only known to us — 
Empires of rhyme, Indies of calculus; 

Listen to distant cocks crow, and discern 
Upon the rough gray wall a rare wall tern; 

And while our royal hands are being tied, 

Taunt our inferiors, cheerfully deride 
The dedicated imbeciles, and spit 
Into their eyes just for the fun of it. 

Nor can one help the exile, the old man 
010 Dying in a motel, with the loud fan 
Revolving in the torrid prairie night 
And, from the outside, bits of colored light 
Reaching his bed like dark hands from the past 
Offering gems; and death is coming fast. 

He suffocates and conjures in two tongues 
The nebulae dilating in his lungs. 

A vuench, a rift — that’s all one can foresee. 
Maybe one finds le grand n4ant; maybe

Fra Karamazov, mumbling his inept

And to fulfill the fish wish of the womb, 

A school of Freudians headed for the tomb. 

That tasteless venture helped me in a way. 

I learnt what to ignore in my survey 
Of death’s abyss. And when we lost our child 
I knew there would be nothing: no self-styled 
Spirit would touch a keyboard of dry wood 
660 To rap out her pet name; no phantom would 
Rise gracefully to welcome you and me 
In the dark garden, near the shagbaik tree.

“I’m sure it’s not the shutter. There— again.” 

“It is a tendril fingering the pane.”

“And now what shall I do? My knight is pinned.” 

Who rides so late in the night and the wind?

Found that my bunch of essays The Untamed

(It sold three hundred copies in one year). 

Again school started, and on hillsides, where 
Wound distant roads, one saw the steady stream 
Of carlights ail returning to the dream 
Of college education. You went on 
Tra islating into French Marvell and Donne. 

It was a year of Tempests: Hurricane

Why Poetry Js Meaningful to Us. 

I g.we my sermon, a dull thing but short. 

As I was leaving in some haste, to thwart

One of those peevish people who attend 
Such talks only to say they disagree

Or one of my old fits. There sat by chance 
A doctor in the front row. At his feet

It heaved and went on trudging to a more 
Conclusive destination. Give me now

Within one stem. And dreadfully distinct 
Against the dark, a tall white fountain played. 

I realized, of course, that it was made 
Not of our atoms; that the sense behind 
710 The scene was not our sense. In life, the mind 
Of any man is quick to recognize 
Natural shams, and then before his eyes 
The reed becomes a bird, the knobby twig 
An inchworm, and the cobra head, a big 
Wickedly folded moth. But in the case 
Of my white fountain what it did replace 
Perceptually was something that, I tell. 

Could be grasped only by whoever dwelt 
In the strange world where I was a mere stray. 

720 And presently I saw it melt away: 

Though still unconscious. I was back on earth. 

The tale I told provoked my doctor’s mirth. 

He doubted very much that in the state 
He found me m “one could hallucinate 
Or dream in any sense. Later, perhaps. 

But not during the actual collapse. 

No, Mr. Shade.” 

But, Doctor, I was dead! 

He smiled. “Not quite: just half a shade,” he said. 

However, I demurred. In mind I kept 
780 Replaying the whole thing. Again I stepped 

Down fiom the platform, and felt strange and hot. 
And saw that chap stand up, and toppled, not 
Because a heckler pointed with his pipe, 

But probably because the time was ripe 
For just that bump and wobble on the part 
Of a limp blimp, an old unstable heart. 

My vision reeked with truth. It had the tone. 

The quiddity and quaintness of its own 
Reality. It was. As time went on, 

740 Its constant vertical in triumph shone. 

Often when troubled by the outer glare 
Of street and strife, inward I'd turn, and there.

There in the background of my soul it stood* 

Old Faithful! And its presence always would 
Console me wonderfully. Then, one day, 

I came across what seemed a twin display. 

It was a story in a magazine 
About a Mrs. Z. whose heart had been 
Rubbed back to Hfe by a prompt surgeon’s hand. 
750 She told her interviewer ot “The Land 

Beyond the Veil” and the account contained 
A hint of angels, and a glint of stained 
Windows, and some soft music, and a choice 
Of hymnal items, and her mother’s voice; 

But at the end she mentioned a remote 
Landscape, a hazy orchard — and I quote: 
“Beyond that orchard through a kind ot smoke 
l glimpsed a tall white fountain — and awoke.” 

If on some nameless island Captain Schmidt 
760 Sees a new animal and captures it, 

And if, a little later, Captain Smith 
Brings back a skm, that island is no myth. 

Our fountain was a signpost and a mark 
Objectively enduring m the dark, 

Strong as a bone, substantial as a tooth, 

And almost vulgar in its robust truthl 

The article was by Jim Coates. To Jim 
Forthwith l wrote. Got het addiess trom him. 
Diove west three hundred miles to talk to her. 

770 Arrived. Was met by an impassioned purr. 

Saw that blue hair, those ireckled hands, that rapt 
Orchideous air — and knew that I was trapped. 

“Who’d miss the opportunity to meet 
A poet so distinguished?” It was sweet 
Of me to come! I desperately tried 
To ask my questions. They were brushed »vde: 
“Perhaps some other time,” The journalist 
Still had her scnbblings. I should not insist. 

She plied me with fruit cake, turning it all 
780 Into an idiotic social call

"I can’t believe,” she said, “that it is you! 

I loved your poem in the Blue Review . 

That one about M on Blon. I have a niece 
Who's climbed the Matterhorn* The other piece 
I could not understand. 1 mean the sense* 

Because, of course, the sound — But I'm so dense!” 

She was. I might have persevered. I might 
Have made her tell me more about the white 
Fountain we both had seen “beyond the veil” 

790 But if (I thought) I mentioned that detail 
She’d pounce upon it as upon a fond 
Affinity, a sacramental bond, 

Uniting mystically her and me, 

And m a jiffy our two souls would be 
Brother and sister trembling on the brink 
Of tender incest. “Well,” 1 said, “1 think 
It’s getting late. . . .” 

I also called on Coates. 

He was afraid he had mislaid her notes. 

He took his article trom a steel file: 
soo “it's accurate. 1 have not changed her style. 

There's one misprint — not that it matters much: 
Mountain , not fountain . The majestic touch.” 

Life Everlasting — based on a misprint! 

I mused as I drove homeward: take the hint. 

And stop investigating my abyss? 

But all at once it dawned on me that this 
Was the real point, the contrapuntal theme; 

Just this: not text, but texture; not the dream 
But topsy-turvical coincidence, 

810 Not flimsy nonsense, but a web of sense. 

Yes! It sufficed that I in life could find 
Some kind of lmk-and-bobolink, some kind 
Of correlated pattern m the game, 

Plexed artistry, and something of the some 
Pleasure in it as they who played it found. 

It did not matter who they were. No sound. 

No furtive light came from their involute 
Abode, but there they were, aloof and mute.

Hold the completed line before one’s eyes.

COMMENTARY 




Lines 1-4: I was the shadow of the waxwing slain, etc. 

the image in these opening lines evidently refers to a bird 
knocking itself out, in full flight, against the outer surface of 
a glass pane in which a mirrored sky, with its slightly darker 
tint and slightly slower cloud, presents the illusion of con- 
tinued space. We can visualize John Shade in his early boy- 
hood, a physically unattractive but otherwise beautifully de- 
veloped lad, experiencing his first eschatological shock, as 
with incredulous fingers he picks up from the turf that com- 
pact ovoid body and gazes at the wax-red streaks ornament- 
ing those gray-brown wings and at the graceful tail feathers 
tipped with yellow as bright as fresh paint. When in the last 
year of Shade's life I had the fortune of being his neighbor in 
the idyllic hills of New Wye (see Foreword), I often saw 
those particular birds most convivially feeding on the chalk- 
blue berries of junipers growing at the corner of his house. 
(See also lines 181-182.) 

My knowledge of garden Aves had been limited to those of 
northern Europe but a young New Wye gardener, in whom I 
was interested (see note to line 998), helped me to identify 
the profiles of quite a number of tropical-looking little strangers 
and their comical calls; and, naturally, every tree top plotted

which I would gallop from the lawn in nomenelatorial agita- 
tion. How hard I found to fit the name “robin” to the suburban 
impostor, the gross fowl, with its untidy dull-red livery and 
the revolting gusto it showed when consuming long, sad, 
passive worms! 

Incidentally, it is curious to note that a crested bird called 
in Zemblan sampel (“silktail”), closely resembling a wax- 
wing in shape and shade, is the model of one of the three 
heraldic creatures (the other two being respectively a reindeer 
proper and a merman azure, crined or) in the armorial bear- 
ings of the Zemblan King, Charles the Beloved (bora 1.915), 
whose glorious misfortunes I discussed so often with my 
friend. 

The poem was begun at the dead center of the year, a few

temptation to synchronize a certain fateful fact, the departure 
from Zembla of the would-be regicide Gradus, with that date. 
Actually, Gradus left Onhava on the Copenhagen plane on 
July 5.

Perhaps an allusion to Zembla, my dear country. After this, 
in the disjointed, half -obliterated dfiaft which I am not at all

Alas, he would have said a great deal more if a domestic 
anti-Karlist had not controlled every line he communicated to 
her! Many a time have I rebuked him in bantering fashion: 
“You really should promise to use all that wonderful stuff, you 
bad gray poet, you!” And we would both giggle hlc boys. But 
then, alter the inspiring evening stroll, we had to part, and 
grim night lifted the drawbridge between bis impregnable 
fortress and my humble home. 

That King’s reign (1936-1958) will be remembered bv at 
least a tew discerning historians as a peaceful and elegant one. 
Owing to a fluid system of judicious alliances. Mars in his time 
never marred the record. Internally, until corruption, betrayal, 
and Extremism penetrated it, the People’s Place (parliament) 
worked in perfect harmony with the Royal Council Harmony, 
indeed, was the reign’s password. The polite arts and pure 
sciences flourished. Technicology, applied physics, industrial 
chemistry and so forth were suffered to thrive. A small sky- 
scraper of ultramarine glass were steadily rising in Onhava. 
The climate seemed to be improving, "taxation bad become a 
thing of beauty. The poor weye getting a little richer, and the 
rich a little poorer (in accordance with what may be known 
some day as Kinbote’s Law). Medical care was spreading to 
the confines of the state: less and less often, on his tour of the 
country, every autumn, when the rowans hung coral-heavy, 
and the puddles tinkled with Muscovy glass, the friendly and 
eloquent monarch would be interrupted by a pertussal “back- 
draucht” in a crowd of schoolchildren. Parachuting had be- 
come a popular sport. Everybody, in a word, was content- 
even the political mischiefmakers who were contentedly

making mischief paid by a contented Sosed (Zambia's gigantic 
neighbor). But let us not pursue this tiresome subject 

To return to the King: take for instance the question of 
personal culture. How often is it that kings engage in some 
special research? ConchoJogists among them can be counted 
on the fingers of one maimed hand. The last king of Zembla 
— partly under the influence of his uncle Conmal, the great 
translator of Shakespeare (see notes to lines 39-40 and 962), 
had become, despite frequent migraines, passionately addicted 
to the study of literature. At forty, not long before the col- 
lapse of his throne, he had attained such a degree of scholar- 
ship that he dared accede to his venerable uncle's raucous 
dying request: “Teach, Karlikl” Of course, it would have 
been unseemly for a monarch to appear in the robes of learn- 
ing at a university lectern and present to rosy youths Finni~ 
gan’s Wake as a monstrous extension of Angus MacDiarmid’s 
‘‘incoherent transactions” and of Southey’s Lingo-Grande 
(“Dear Stumparuniper, 1 ' etc.) or discuss the Zemblan variants, 
collected in 1798 by Hodinski, of the Kongs-skugg-sio ( The 
Royal Mirror)* an anonymous masterpiece of the twelfth 
century. Therefore he lectured under an assumed name and in 
a heavy make-up, with wig and false whiskers. All brown- 
bearded, apple-cheeked, blue-eyed Zemblam look alike, and^ 
1 who have not shaved now for a year, resemble my disguised 
king (see also note to line 894), 

During these periods of teaching, Charles Xavier made it a 
rule to sleep at a pied d-terre he had rented, as any scholarly 
citizen would, in Coriolanus Lane: a charming, central-heated 
studio with adjacent bathroom and kitchenette. One recalls 
with nostalgic pleasure its light gray carpeting ?n d pearl-gray 
walls (one of them graced with a solitary copy of Picasso’s 
Chandelier , pot et casserole SmaUee) t a shellful of calf-hound 
poets, and a virginal-looking daybed under its rug of imitation 
panda fur. How far from this limpid simplicity seemed the 
palace and the odious Council Chamber with its unsolvable 
problems and lrightened councilors!

By an extraordinary coincidence (inherent peihaps in the 
contrapuntal nature of Shade’s art) our poet seems to name

(July 2) he could not have known. Jakob Gradus called him- 
self variously Jack Degree or Jacques de Grey, or James de 
Gray, and also appears in police records as Ravus, Raven- 
stone, and d* Argus, Having a morbid affection for the ruddy 
Russia of the Soviet era, he contended that the real origin of 
his name should be sought in the Russian word for grape, 
y inograd, to which a Latin suffix had adhered, making it 
Vinogradus. His father, Martin Gradus, had been a Protes- 
tant minister in Riga, but except for him and a maternal uncle 
(Roman Tselovalnikov, police officer and part-time member 
of the Social-Revolutionary party), the whole clan seems to 
have been in the liquor business. Martin Gradus died in 1920, 
and his widow moved to Strasbourg where she soon died, too. 
Another Gradus, an Alsatian merchant, who oddly enough 
was totally unrelated to our killer but had been a close busi- 
ness friend of his kinsmen for years, adopted the boy and 
raised him with his own children. It would seem that at one 
time young Gradus studied pharmacology in Zurich, and at 
another, traveled to misty vineyards as an itinerant wine taster. 
We find him next engaging in petty subversive activities — 
printing peevish pamphlets, acting as messenger for obscure 
syndicalist groups, organizing strikes at glass factories, and 
that sort of thing. Sometime in the forties he came to Zembla 
as a brandy salesman. There he married a publican’s daugh- 
ter. His connection with the Extremist party dates from its 
first ugly writhings, and when the revolution broke out, his 
modest organizational gifts found some appreciation in vari- 
ous offices. His departure for Western Europe, with a sordid 
purpose in his heart and a loaded gun in his pocket, took 
place on the very day that an innocent poet in an innocent 
land was beginning Canto Two of Pale Fire . We shall ac- 
company Gradus in constant thought, as he makes his way 
from distant dim Zembla to green Appalachia, through the 
entire length of the poem, following the road of its rhythm, 
riding past in a rhyme, skidding around the corner of a 
run-on, breathing with the caesura, swinging down to the 
foot of the page from line to line as from branch to branch, 
hiding between two words (see note to line 596), reappearing 
on the horizon of a new canto, steadily marching nearer in 
iambic motion, crossing streets, moving up with his valise 
on the escalator of the pentameter, stepping off, boarding a

Line 42: I could make out 

By the end of May I could make out the outlines ot some 
of my images in the shape his genius might give them, by 
mid-June I felt sure at last that he would tecreate m a poem 
the dazzling Zembla burning in my brain. 1 mesmerized him 
with it, 1 saturated him with my vision, I pressed upon him, 
with a drunkard's wild generosity, all that I was helpless 
myself to put into verse Suicly, it would not be easy to dis- 
cover in the history of poetry a similar case — that of two 
men, different in origin, upbringing, thought associations, spii- 
itual intonation and mental mode, one a cosmopolitan scholar, 
the other a fireside poet, entering into a seciet compact ot 
this kind. At length I knew be was ripe with mv Zembla, 
bursting with suitable rhymes, ready to spiut at the brush 
of any eyelash. I kept urging him at every opportunity to sur- 
mount his habitual sloth and start writing. My little pocket 
diary contains such jottings as: “Suggested to him the heioic 
measure”; “retold the escape”; “offered the use of a quiet 
room in my house”; “discussed making recordings ot my 
voice for his use”, and finally, under date ot July 3. “poem 
begun!” 

Although I realize only too clearly, alas, that the result, 
in its pale and diaphanous final phase, cannot be regarded 
as a direct echo of my narrative (ot which, incidentally, only 
a few fragments axe given in my notes — mainly to Canto 
One), one can hardly doubt that the sunset glow of the story 
acted as a catalytic agent upon the very process of the sus- 
tained creative effervescence that enabled Shade to produce 
a 1000-line poem m three weeks. There is, moreover, a symp- 
tomatic family resemblance in the coloration of both poem 
and story. 1 have reread, not without pleasure, my comments

to his lines, and in many cases have caught myself borrowing 
a kind of opalescent light from my poet’s fiery orb, and un- 
consciously aping the prose style of his own critical essays. 
But his widow, and his colleagues, may stop worrying and 
enjoy in full the fruit of whatever advice they gave my good- 
natured poet. Oh yes, the final text of the poem is entirely his. 

If we discount, as I think we should, three casual allusions 
to royalty (605, 822 , and 894) and the Popian ‘'Zembla” in 
line 937, we may conclude that the final text of Pale Fire 
has been deliberately and drastically drained of eveiy trace 
of the material I contributed; but we also find that despite 
the control exercised upon my poet by a domestic censor 
and God knows whom else, he has given the royal fugitive 
a refuge m the vaults of the variants he has preserved; for in 
his draft as many as thirteen verses, superb singing verses 
(given by me in note to lines 70, 79, and 130, all in Canto 
One, which he obviously worked at with a greater degree of 
creative freedom than be enjoyed afterwards) bear Ini spe- 
cific imprint of my theme, a minute but genuine star ghost 
of my discourse on Zembla and her unfortunate king. 

Lines 47-48: the frame house between Goldsworth and 
Wordsmith 

The first name refers to the house in Dulwich Road that I 
rented from Hugh Warren Goldsworth, authority on Roman 
Law and distinguished judge. I never had the pleasure of 
meeting mv landlord but I came to know his handwriting 
almost as well as I do Shade’s. The second name denotes, of 
course, Wordsmith University, In seeming to suggest a mid- 
way situation between the two places, our poet is less con- 
cerned with spathd exactitude than wi h a wittv exchange of 
syllables invoking the two masters of the heroic couplet, be- 
tween whom he embowers his own muse. Actually, the “frame 
house on its square of green” was five miles west of the 
Wordsmith campus but only fifty yards or so distant from 
my cast windows. 

In the Foreword to this work I have had occasion to say 
something about the amenities of my habitation. The charm- 
ing, charmingly vague lady (see note to line 691), who se- 
cured it for me, sight unseen, meant well, no doubt, especially 
since it was widely admired in the neighborhood for its “old- 
world spaciousness and graciousness.” Actually, it was an old,

dismal, white-and-black, half-timbered house, of the type 
termed wodrtaggen in my country, with carved gables, drafty 
bow windows and a so-called ‘'semi-noble” porch, surmounted 
by a hideous veranda. Judge Goldsworth had a wife and four 
daughters. Family photographs met me in the hallway and 
pursued me from room to room, and although I am sure that 
Alphina (9), Betty (10), Candida (12), and Dee (14) will 
soon change from horribiy cute little schoolgirl* to smart 
young ladies and superior mothers, I must confess that their 
pert pictures irritated me to such an extent that finally 1 gath- 
ered them one by one and dumped them dll in a closet under 
the gallows row of their cellophane-shrouded winter clothes. 
In the study I found a large picture of their parents, with 
sexes reversed, Mrs. G. resembling Malenkov, and Mr. G. a 
Medusa-locked hag, and this I replaced by the leproduction 
of a beloved early Picasso: earth boy leading raincloud horse. 
I did not bother, though, to do much about the family books 
which were also all over the house — foui sets ot different 
Children’s Encyclopedias, and a stolid grown-up one that as- 
cended all the way lrom shelf to shelf along a flight of stairs 
to burst and appendix in the attic. Judging bv the novels in 
Mrs. Goldsworth’s boudoir, her intellectual interests were 
fully developed, going as they did from Amber to Zen. The 
head of this alphabetic family had a library too, but this 
consisted mainly of legal works and a lot ol conspicuously 
lettered ledgers. All the layman could glean tor instruction 
and entertainment was a morocco-bound album in which the 
judge had lovingly pasted the life histories and pictures of 
people he had sent to pmou or condemned to death: un- 
forgettable faces of imbecile hoodlums, last smokes and last 
grins, a strangler’s quite ordinary-looking hands, a self-made 
widow, the close-set merciless eyes of a homicidal maniac 
(somewhat resembling, I admit, the late Jacques d’ Argus), 
a bright little parricide aged seven (“Now, sonny, we want 
you to tell us — “), and a sad pudgy old pederast who had 
blown up his blackmailer. What rather surprised me was that 
be, my learned landlord, and not his “missus,” directed the 
household. Not only had he left me a detailed inventory of 
all such articles as cluster around a new tenant like a mob 
of menacing natives, but he had taken stupendous pains to 
write out on slips of paper recommendations, explanations, 
injunctions and supplementary lists. Whatever I touched on

the first day of my stay yielded a specimen of Goldsworthiana. 
I unlocked the medicine chest in the second bathroom, and 
out fluttered a message advising me that the slit tor discarded 
safety blades was too full to use. 1 opened the icebox, and 
it warned me with a bark that “no national specialties with 
odors hard to get rid of” should be placed therein. I pulled 
out the middle drawer of the desk in the study — and dis- 
covered a catalogue raisonm * of its meager contents which 
included an assortment of ashtrays, a damask paperknife 
(described as “one ancient dagger brought by Mrs Golds* 
worth’s father from the Orient”), and an o*d but unused 
pucket diary optimisucally maturing there until its calendric 
correspondencies came around again. Among various detailed 
notices affixed to a special board in the pantry, such as plumb- 
ing instructions, dissert dtions on electricity, discourse* on cac- 
tuses and so forth, I tound the diet of the black cat that 
came with the house:

(All it got trom me was milk and sardines; it was a likable 
little creature but after a while its movements began to grate 
on my nerves and 1 farmed it out to Mrs Finley, the cleaning 
woman ) But perhaps the funniest note concerned the ma- 
nipulations ot the window curtains which had to bo drawn 
in different ways at diffeier* hours to prevent the sun from 
getting at the upholstery. A description of the position of 
the sun, daily and seasonal, was given for the several win- 
dows, and if I had heeded all this I would have been kept 
as busy as a participant in a regatta. A footnote, however, 
generously suggested thaL instead of manning the curtains, 1 
might prefer to shift and reshift out of sun range the more 
precious pieces ot furniture (two embroidered armchairs and 
a heavy “royal console”) but should do it c ruefully lest I 
scratch the wall moldings. 1 cannot, alas, repr^vduce the me-

Thank God, his robust hilarity dissipated the atmosphere of 
damnum infectum in which I was supposed to dwell. On his 
part, he regaled me with a number of anecdotes concerning 
the judge's dry wit and courtroom mannerisms; most of these 
anecdotes were doubtless folklore exaggerations, a few were 
evident inventions, and all were harmless. He did not bring

scarlet skies, the darkening dunes of a fabulous kingdom, 
simply do not exist But enough of this. Let us turn to our 
poet’s windows 1 have no desire to twist and batter an un- 
ambiguous apparatus criticus into the monstrous semblance of 
a novel 

Today it would be impossible for me to describe Shade's 
house m terms or architecture or indeed in an&gt; term other 
than those of peeps and glimpses, aud window-framed op- 
portunities As previously mentioned (see foreword), the 
coming of summer presented a problem m optics, the en- 
croaching foliage d«d not always see e&gt;e to eve with me* it 
confused a green monocle with an opaque occludcnt, and the 
idea of protection with that of obstruction. Meanwhile (on 
July 3 according to my agenda) I had learned — not from 
John but from Sybil — that my friend had started to work on 
a Jong poem After not having seen him for a couple ol days, 
I happened to be bringing him some third-class mail from 
his box on the road, adjacent to Goldswoith’s (which 1 used 
to ignore, crammed as it was with leaflets, local advertise- 
ments, commercial catalogues, and that kind of trash) and 
ran into Sybil whom a shrub had screened fiom my falcon 
eye. Straw-hatted and garden gloved, she was squatting on 
her hams in front of a flower bed and pruning or tying up 
something, and her close-fitting brown trousers reminded me 
of the mandolin tights (as 1 jokingly called them) that my 
own wife used to wear. She said not to bother him with those 
ads and added the information about his having “begun a 
really big poem.” I lelt the blood rush to my face and mum- 
bled something about his not having shown any of it to me 
yet, and she straightened herself, and swept the black and

gray hair off her forehead, and stared at me, and said: 
“What do you mean — shown any of it? He never shows any- 
thing unfinished Never, never He will not even discuss it 
with you until it is quite, quite finished ” I could not believe 
it, but soon discovered on talking to my strangely reticent 
friend that he had been well coached by his lady When I 
endeavored to draw him out by means of good-natured sallies 
such as : “People who live in glass houses should not write 
poems ” he would only yawn and shake his head, and retort 
that “foreigners ought to keep away from old saws ” Never- 
theless the urge to find out what he was doing with all the 
live, glamorous, palpitating, shimmering material I had lav- 
ished upon him, the itching desire to see him at work (even 
if the fruit of his work was denied me), proved to be utterly 
agonizing and uncontrollable and led me to indulge m an orgy 
of spying which no considerations of pride could stop

PALE FIRE 


during an interval in hymnal practice. As I mooned there, 
lifting and cooling my bare calves by turns against a smooth 
column, I could hear the distant sweet voices interblending 
in subdued boyish merriment which some chance grudge, 
some jealous annoyance with one particular lad, prevented 
me from joining, rhe sound of rapid steps made me raise 
my morose gaze from the sectile mosaic of the court — real- 
istic rose petals cut out of xodstein and large, almost palpable 
tborns cut out of green maible. Into these roses and thorns 
there walked a black shadow: a tall, pale, long-nosed, dark- 
haired young minister whom 1 had seen around once or twice 
strode out of the vestry and without seeing me stopped in the 
middle of the court. Guilty disgust contorted his thin lips. 
He wore spectacles. His clenched hands seemed to be grip- 
ping invisible prison bars. But there is no bound to the meas- 
ure of grace which man may be able to receive. All at once 
his look changed to one of rapture and reverence. I had 
never seen such a blaze of bliss before but was to perceive 
something of that splendor, of that spiritual energy and di- 
vine vision, now, in another land, reflected upon the nigged 
and homely face of old John Shade. How gUd I was that the 
vigils I had kept all through the spung had prepared me 
to observe him at his miraculous midsummer task* I had 
learned exactly when and where to find the best points from 
which to follow the contours of his inspiration My binocu- 
lars would seek him out and focus upon him from afar m 
his various places of labor: at night, in the violet glow of 
his upstairs study where a kindly mirroi reflected for me his 
hunched-up shoulders and the pencil with which he kept 
picking his ear (inspecting now and then the lead, and even 
tasting it); in the forenoon, lurking tn the ruptured shadows 
of his first-floor study where a bright goblet ot liquor quietly 
traveled from filing cabinet to lectern, and fiom lectern to 
bookshelf, there to hide it need be behind Dante’s bust; on 
a hot day, among the vines of a small arborlike portico, 
through the garlands of which I could glimpse a stretch of 
oilcloth, his elbow upon it, and the plump cherubic fist prop- 
ping and crimpiing his temple. Incidents of perspective and 
lighting, intertcience by iramework or leaves, usually de- 
prived me of a clear view of his face; and perhaps nature 
arranged it that way so as to conceal from a possible predator 
the mysteries of generation; but sometimes when the poet

moment on the bench at the end of it, or paused under his

tory “promnad vespert mid J.S . /’ crossed out with a petu- 
lance that broke the lead in midstroke* Having waited and 
waited for my friend to join me in the lane, until the red of 
the sunset had turned to the ashes of dusk, 1 walked over to 
his front door, hesitated, assessed the gloom and the silence, 
and started to walk around the house. This time not a glint 
came from the hack parlor, but by the bright prosaic light in 
the kitchen I distinguished one end of a whitewashed table 
and Sybil sitting at it with so rapt a look on her face that one 
might have supposed she had just thought up a new recipe. 
The back door was ajar, and as I tapped it open and launched 
upon some gay airy phrase, T realized that Shade, sitting at 
the other end of the table, was in the act of reading to her 
something that I guessed to be a part of his poem. They 
both started. An unprintable oath escaped from him and he 
slapped down on the table the stack of index cards he had in 
his hand. Later he was to attribute this temperamental out- 
burst to his having mistaken, with his reading glasses on, a 
welcome friend for an intruding salesman; but I must sav it 
shocked me, it shocked me greatly, and imposed me at the 
time to read a hideous meaning into everything that followed. 
“Well, sit down,” said Sybil, “and have some coffee” (victors 
are generous). I accepted, as I wanted to see if the recitation 
tvould be continued m my presence. It was not ‘I thought,' 1 
I said to nty friend, “you were coming out with me for a 
stroll.” He excused himself saying he felt out of sorts, and 
continued to dean the bowl of his pipe as fiercely as if it were 
my heart he was hollowing out. 

Not only did I understand then that Shade regularly read 
to Sybil cumulative parts of his poem but it also dawns upon 
me now that, just as regularly, she made him tone down or 
remove from his Lair Copy everything connected with the 
magnificent Zemblan theme with which 1 kept furnishing him 
and which, without knowing much about the growing work, 
I fondly believed would become the main rich thread in its 
weave!

sacred trees planted by a landscaper of genius (Repburg) at 
the end of the so-called Shakespeare Avenue, on the campus.

The light is good; the reading lamps, long-necked;

When planning parents’ bedrooms, he insists 
On lockless doors so that, when looking back, 

The future patient of the future quack 
May find, all set for him, the Primal Scene.

In the otherwise empt), and pretty fatuous, obituary men-

a manuscript poem (received from Sybil Shade) which is said 
to have been “composed by our poet apparently at the end 
of June, thus less than a month before our poet’s death, thus 
being the last short piece that our poet wiote.” 

Here it is:

I not have given for the poets suffering another heart

for it in an attractive setting, suddenly reappeared on the

PALE FIRE 


There are events, strange happenings, that strike 
The mind as emblematic. They are like 
Lost similes adrift without a string, 

Attached to nothing. Thus that northern king, 

Whose desperate escape from prison was 
Brought off successfully only because 
Some forty of his followers that night 
Impersonated him and aped his flight — 

He never would have reached the western coast had not 
a fad spread among his secret supporters, romantic, heroic 
daredevils, of impersonating the fleeing king They rigged 
themselves out to look like him in red sweaters and red caps, 
and popped up here and there, completely bewildering the 
revolutionary police. Some of the pranksters weie much 
younger than the King, but this did not matter since his pic- 
tures in the huts of mountain folks and m the myopic shops 
of hamlets, where you could buy worms, ginger biead and 
zhiletka blades, had not aged since his coronation. A charm- 
ing cartoon touch w f as added on the famous occasion when 
from the terrace of the Kronbhk Hotel, whose chairlift takes 
tourists to the Kron glacier, one merry mime was seen float- 
ing up, like a red moth, with a hapless, and capless, police- 
man riding two seats behind him in dream-slow pursuit. It 
gives one pleasure to add that before reaching the staging 
point, the false king managed to escape by climbing down 
one of the pvlons that supported the traction cable (see also 
notes to lines 149 and 171). 

Line 71: parents 

With commendable alacrity, Professor Hurley produced 
an Appreciation of John Shade’s published works within a 
month after the poet’s death. It came out m a skimpy literary 
review, whose name momentarily escapes me, and was shown 
to me in Chicago where I interrupted for a couple of days my 
automobile journey from New Wye to Cedarn, in these grim 
autumnal mountains. 

A Commentary where placid scolarship should reign is not 
the place for blasting ihe preposterous defects of that little 
obituary. I have only mentioned it because that is where I 
gleaned a few meager details concerning the poet’s parents. 
His father, Samuel Shade, who died at fifty, in 1902, had 



Commentary 73 

studied medicine m his youth and was vice-president of a 
firm ot surgical instruments in Exton. His chief passion, how- 
ever, was what our eloquent necrologist calls “the study of 
the feathered tribe,” adding that “a bird had been named 
for him: Bomby cilia Shader (this should be “shadei,” of 
course). The poet's mother, nee Caroline Lukin, assisted him 
in his work and drew the admirable figures of his Birds of 
Mexico , which I remember having seen in my friend's house. 
What the obituarist does not know is that Lukin comes from 
Luke, as also do Locock and Luxon and Lukashevich. It 
repiesents one of the many instances when the amorphous- 
looking but live and personal hereditary patronymic grows, 
sometimes in fantastic shapes, around the common pebble of 
a Cliristian name. The I ukins are an old Essex family. Other 
names derive from professions such as Rymer, Scrivener, 
Limner (one who illuminates parchments), Botkin (one who 
makes bottekins, lancy footwear) and thousands of otters. 
My tutor, a Scotsmar. used to call any old tumble-down 
building “a hurley-house." But enough of this. 

A few other items concerning John Shade’s university 
studies and the middle years of his singularly uneventful life 
can be looked up by his reader in the professor's article. It 
would have been on the whole a dull piece had it not been 
enlivened, if that is the term, by certain special features. 
Thus, there is only one allusion to my friend’s masterpiece 
(the neatly stacked batches of which, as I write this, lie in 
the sun on my table as so many ingots of fabulous metal) and 
this 1 transcribe with morbid delight: “Just before our poet’s 
untimely death he seems to have been working on an auto- 
biographical poem.” The circumstances of this death are com- 
pletely distorted by the professor, a fateful follower of the 
gentlemen of the daily press who — perhaps Cor political rea- 
sons — had falsified the culprit’s motives and intentions with- 
out awaiting his trial — which unfortunately was not to take 
place in this world (see eventually my ultimate note). But, 
of course, the most striking characteristic of the little obituary 
is that it contains not one reference to the glorious friendship 
that brightened the last months of John’s life. 

My friend could not evoke the image of his father. Simi- 
larly the King, who also was not quite three when his father, 
King Alfin, died, was unable to recall his face, although oddly 
he did remember perfectly well the little monoplane ot choco-

late that he, a chubby babe, happened to be holding in that 
very last photograph (Christmas 1918) of the melancholy, 
riding-breeched aviator in whose lap he reluctanly and un- 
comfortably sprawled. 

Alfin the Vague (1873-1918; regnal dates 1900-1918, but 
1900-1919 in most biographical dictionaries, a fumble due 
to the coincident calendar change from Old Style to New) 
was given his cognomen b) Amphitheatncus, a not unkindly 
writer of fugitive poetry in the liberal gazettes (who was 
also responsible lor dubbing my capital Uranogradl). King 
Alfin’s absent-mindedness knew no bounds. He was a wretched 
linguist having at his disposal only a few phrases of French 
and Danish, but every time he had to make a speech to his 
subjects — to a group of gaping Zemblan yokels in some re- 
mote valley where he had crash-hnded — some uncontrollable 
switch went into action in his mind, and he reverted to those 
phrases, flavoring them for topical sense with a little Latin. 
Most ot the anecdotes relating to his naive fits of abstrac- 
tion are too silly and indecent to sully these pages; but one of 
them that I do not thank especially funny induced such guf- 
faws from Shade (and returned to me, via the Common 
Room, with such obscene accretions) that I feel inclined to 
give it here as a sample (and as a corrective). One summer 
before the first world w lr, when the emperor of a great for- 
eign realm (I realize how few there arc to choose from) was 
paying an extremely uuusual and flattering visit to our little 
hard country, my father took him and a young Zemblan in- 
terpreter (whose sex I leave open) in a newlv purchased 
custom-built car on a jaunt in the countryside. As usual, 
King Alfin traveled without a vestige of escort, and this, and 
his brisk driving, seemed to trouble his guest. On their way 
back, some twenty miles from Onhava, King Alfin decided 
to stop for repairs. While he tinkered with the motor, the 
emperor and the interpreter sought the shade of some pines 
by the highway, and only when King Alfin was back in 
Onhava, did he gradually realize from a reiteration of rather 
frantic questions that he had left somebody behind (“What 
emperor?” has remained his only memorable mot). Generally 
speaking, in respect of any of my contributions (or what 1 
thought to be contributions) I repeatedly enjoined my poet 
to record them in writing, by all means, but not to spread 
then! in idle speech; even poets, however, are human. 



Commentary 75 

King Alfin’s absent-mindedness was strangely combined 
with a passion for mechanical things, especially for flying 
apparatuses. In 1912, he managed to rise in an umbrella-like 
Fabre “hydroplane” and almost got drowned in the sea be- 
tween Nitra and Indra. He smashed two Farmans, three Zem- 
blan machines, and a beloved Santos Dumont Demoiselle * A 
very special monoplane, Blenda IV, was built for him in 1916 
by his constant “aerial adjutant,” Colonel Peter Gusev (later 
a pioneer parachutist and, at seventy, one of the greatest 
jumpers of all time), and this was his bird of doom. On the 
serene, and not too cold, December morning that the angels 
chose to net his mild pure soul, King Alfin was in the act of 
trying solo a tricky vertical loop that Prince Andrey Kachurin, 
the famous Russian stuater and War One hero, had shown 
him in Gatchina. Something went wrong, and the little Blenda 
was seen to go into an uncontrolled dive. Behind and ^bove 
him, in a Caudron biplane. Colonel Gusev (by then Duke 
of Rahl) and the Queen snapped several pictures of what 
seemed at first a noble and graceful evolution but then turned 
into something else. At the last moment, King Alfin managed 
to straighten out his machine and was again master of gravity 
when, immediately afterwards, he flew smack into the scaf- 
folding of a huge hotel which was being constructed in the mid- 
dle of a coastal heath as if for the special purpose of standing 
in a king’s way. This uncompleted and badly gutted building 
was ordered razed by Queen Blenda who had it replaced by a 
tasteless monument of granite surmounted by an improbable 
type of aircraft made ot bronze. The glossy prints of the en- 
larged photographs depicting the entire catastrophe were dis- 
covered one day by eight-year-old Charles Xavier in the drawer 
of a secretary bookcase. In some of these ghastly pictures one 
could make out the shoulders and leathern casque of the 
strangely unconcerned aviator, and in the penultimate one of 
the series, just before the white-blurred shattering crash, one 
distinctly saw him raise one arm in triumph and reassurance. 
The boy had hideous dreams after that but his mother never 
found out that he had seen those mfernaljrecords. 

Her he remembered — more or less: a horsewoman, tall, 
broad, stout, ruddy-faced. She had been assured by a royal 
cousin that her son would be safe and happy under the tute- 
lage of admirable Mr. Campbell who had taught several dutiful 
little princesses to spread butterflies and enjoy Lord Ronald's

Coronach . He had immolated his life, so to speak, at the 
portable altars of a vast number of hobbies, from the study of 
book mites to bear hunting, and could reel off Macbeth from 
beginning to end during hikes; but he did not give a damn for 
his charges’ morals, preferred ladies to laddies, and did not 
meddle in the complexities of Zemblan ingledom. He left, for 
some exotic court, after a ten-year stay, in 1932 when our 
Prince, aged seventeen, had begun dividing his time between 
the University and his regiment. It was the nicest period m his 
life. He never could decide what he enjoyed more: the study 
of poetry — especially English poetry — or attending parades, or 
dancing in masquerades with boy-girls and girl-boys. His 
mother died suddenly on July 21, 1936, from an obscure blood 
ailment that had also afflicted her mother and grandmother. 
She had been much better on the day before — and Charles 
Xavier had gone to an all-night ball m the so-called Ducal 
Dome in Gnndelwod: lor the nonce, a foimal heterosexual 
affair, rather refreshing after some previous sport. At about 
four in the morning, with the sun enflammg the tree crests and 
Mt, Falk, a pink cone, the king stopped his powerful car at 
one of the gates of the palace. The air was so delicate, the light 
so lyrical, that he and the three friends he had with him de- 
cided to walk through the linden bosquet the rest of the dis- 
tance to the Pavonian Pavilion where guests were lodged He 
and Otar, a platonic pal, wore tails but the) bad lost their top 
hats to the highway winds. A strange something struck all 
four of them as they stood under the voung limes m the prim 
landscape of scaip and counterscarp fortified by shadow and 
countershadow. Otar, a pleasant and cultured adding with a 
tremendous nose and sparse hair, had his two mistresses with 
him, eighteen-year-old Filalda (whom he later married) and 
seventeen-year -old Fleur (whom we shall meet in two other 
notes), daughters ot Countess de Fylcr, the Queen’s favorite 
lady in waiting. One involuntarily lingers over that picture, as 
one does when standing at a vantage point of time and know- 
ing in retrospect that in a moment one’s life would undergo a 
complete change. So here was Otar, looking with a puzzled 
expression at the distant windows of the Queen’s quarters, and 
there were the two girls, side by side, thin-legged, in shimmer- 
ing wraps, their kitten noses pink, their eyes green and sleepy, 
their earrings catching and loosing the fire of the sun. There 
were a few people around, as there always were, no matter the

hour, at this gate, along which a road, connecting with the 
Eastern highway, ran. A peasant woman with a small cake she 
had baked, doubtlessly the mother of the sentinel who had 
not yet come to relieve the unshaven dark young nattdett 
(child of night) in his drear)' sentry box, sat on a spur stone 
watching in feminine fascination the lueiola-like tapers that 
moved from window to window; two workmen, holding their 
bicycles, stood staring too at those strange lights; and a drunk 
with a walrus mustache kept staggering around and patting 
the trunks of the lindens. One picks up minor items at such 
slowdowns of life. The King noticed that some reddish mud 
flecked the frames of the two bicycles and that their front 
wheels were both turned in the same direction, parallel to one 
another. Suddenly, down a steep path among the lilac bushes — 
a short cut from the Queen's quarters — the Countess came 
running and tripping over the hem of her quilted robe, at 
the same moment, irom another side of the palace, all seven 
councilors, dressed m their tormal splendor and carrying like 
plum cakes replicas of various regalia, came striding down the 
stairs ol stone, in dignified haste, but she beat them by one 
alin and spat out the news. The drunk started to sing a ribald 
ballad about “Karhe-Garlie” and fell into the demilune ditch. 
Tt is not easy to describe lucidly in short notes to a poem the 
various approaches to a fortified castle, and so, in my aware- 
ness of this problem, I prepared for John Shade, some time in 
June, wheu narrating to him the events briefly noticed in some 
ol my comments (sec note to line 130, tor example), a rather 
handsomely drawn plan of the chambers, terraces, bastions 
and pleasure grounds of the Onhava Palace. Unless it has been 
destroyed or stolen, this careful picture in colored inks on a 
large (thirty by twenty inches) piece of cardboard might still 
be where I last saw it in inid-Julv, on the top of the big black 
trunk, opposite the old mangle, in a niche ol the little corridor 
leading to the so-called fruit room. If it is not there, it might 
be looked for in his upper-floor study. 1 have written about 
this to Mrs. Shade but she does not reply to my letters. In case 
it still exists, I wish to beg her, without .raising mv voice, and

Line 79: a preterist 

Written against this in the margin of the draft are two lines 
of which only the first can be deciphered. It reads: 

The evening is the time to praise the day 

I feel pretty sure that my friend was trying to incorporate 
here- something he and Mrs. Shade had heard me quote in my 
lighter-hearted moments, namely a charming quatrain from 
our Zemblan counterpart of the Elder Edda, in an anonymous 
English translation (Kirby's?) : 

The wise at nightfall praise the day. 

The wife when she has passed away, 

The ice when it is crossed, the bride 
When tumbled, and the horse when tried. 

Line SO: my bedroom 

Our Prince was fond of Fleur as of a sister but with no 
soft shadow of incest or secondary homosexual complications. 
She had a small pale face with prominent cheekbones, lumi- 
nous eyes, and curly dark hair. It was rumored that after go- 
ing about with a porcelain cup and Cinderella's slipper for 
months, the society sculptor and poet Arnor had found in her 
what he sought and had used her breasts and feet for his Lilith 
Calling Back Adam; but I am certainly no expert in these 
tender matters. Otar, her lover, said that when you walked 
behind her, and she knew you were walking behind her, the 
swing and play of those shm haunches was something intensely 
artistic, something Arab girls were taught in special schools by 
special Parisian panders who were afterwards strangled. Her 
fragile ankles, he said, which she placed very close together 
in her dainty and wavy walk, were the “careful jewels” in 
Amor’s poem about a miragarl (“mirage girl”), for which “a

part of the Court Chamberlain. She took to sleeping in a small 
antechamber next to his bachelor bedroom, a splendid spacious 
circular apartment at the top of the high and massive South 
West Tower. This had been his father’s retreat and was still 
connected by a jolly chute in the wall with a round swimming 
pool in the hall below, so that the young Prince could start the 
day as his father used to start it by slipping open a panel be- 
side his army cot and rolling into the shaft whence he whizzed 
down straight into bright water. For other needs than sleep 
Charles Xavier had installed in the middle of the Persian rug- 
covercd floor a so-called patifolia, that is. a huge, oval, luxuri- 
ously flounced, swansdown pillow the size of a triple bed. It 
was in this ample nest that Fleur now slept, curled up in its 
central hollow, under a coverlet of genuine giant panda fur 
that had just been rushed from Tibet by a group of Asiatic 
well-wishers on the occasion of his ascension to the throne.

own inner staircase and bathroom, but also communicated by 
means of a sliding door with the West Gallery 1 do not know 
what advice or command her mother had given Fleur; but the 
little thing proved a poor seducer. She kept trying, as one 
quietly insane, to mend a broken viola d’ am ore or sat in 
dolorous attitudes comparing two ancient flutes, both sad-tuned 
and feeble. Meantime, in Turkish garb, he lolled m his father’s 
ample chair, his legs ovei its arm, flipping through a volume 
*of Historia Zembhra, copying out passages and occasionally 
Ashing out of the nether recesses of his seat a pair of old- 
fashioned motoring goggles, a black opal ring, a ball of silver 
chocolate wrapping, or the star of a foreign order. 

It was warm in the evening sun. She wore on the second day 
of their ridiculous cohabitation nothing except a kind of but- 
tonless and sleeveless pajama top. The sight of her four bare 
limbs and three mousepits ( Zemblan anatomy) irritated him, 
and while pacing about and pondering his coronation speech, 
he would toss towards her, without looking, her shorts or a 
terrycloth robe. Sometimes, upon returning to the comfortable 
old chair he would find her in it contemplating sorrowfully the 
picture of a bogtur (ancient warrior) in the history book. He 
would sweep her out of his chair, his eyes still on his writing 
pad, and stretching herself she would move over to the window 
seat and its dusty sunbeam; but after a while she tried to cud- 
dle up to him, and he had to push away her burrowing dark

the student of Shade’s poem will reach in due time; there is

still around, though indistinctly so. Disa befriended her after

destroyed by fire, Gradus helping the fire brigade to clear a 
Space in the square for the lynching of the non-union incen-

Denmark) who had been mistaken for them. Our young 
Queen may have felt some subtle sympathy lor her pale lady 
in waiting whom fiom time to time the King glimpsed illu- 
minating a concert program by the diagonal light of an ogival 
window, or heard making tinny music in Bower B. The beauti- 
ful bedroom of his bachelor days is alluded to again in a note 
to line 130, as the place of his “luxurious captivity” in the 
beginning of the tedious and unnecessary Zemblan Revolu- 
tion.

Pius X, Giuseppe Melchiotre Sarto, 1835 1014; Pope 1903-

Lines 86-90: Aunt Maud 

Maud Shade, 1869-1050, Samuel Shade’s sister. At her 
death, Hazel (bom 1934* was not exactly a “babe” as implied 
in line 90. I found her paintings unpleasant but interesting. 
Aunt Maud was far from spinsterish, and the extravagant and 
sardonic turn of her mind must have shocked sometimes the 
genteel dames of New Wye. 

Lines 90-93. Her room, etc. 

In the draft, instead of the final text:

hickory.” I suspect Shade altered this passage because his 
moth’s name clashed with “Moon” in the next line. 

Line 91: trivia 

Among these was a scrapbook in which over a period of 
years (1937-1949) Aunt Maud had been pasting clippings of 
an involuntarily ludicrous or grotesque nature. John Shad$ 
allowed me one day to memorandum the first and the last of 
the scries; they happened to intercommunicate most pleas- 
ingly, I thought. Both stemmed from the same family maga- 
zine Life , so justly famed lor its pudibundity in regard to the 
mysteries of the male sex; hence one can well imagine how 
startled or titillated those families were. The first comes from 
the issue of May 10, 1937, p. 67, and advertises the Talon 
Trouser Fastener (a iather grasping and painful name, by the 
way). It shows a young gent radiating virility among several 
ecstatic lady-friends, and the inscription reads: You'll be 
amazed that the fly of your trousers could he so dramatically 
improved . The second comes from the issue of March 28, 
1949, p. 126, and advertises Hanes Fig Leaf Brief. It shows a 
modern Eve worshipfuliy peeping from behind a potted tree of 
knowledge at a leering young Adam in rather ordinary but 
clean underwear, with the front of his advertised brief con- 
spicuously and compactly shaded, and the inscription reads: 
Nothing beats a fig leaf . 

I think there must exist a special subversive group of 
pseudo-cupids — plump hairless little devils whom Satan com- 
missions to make disgusting mischief in sacrosanct places. 

Line 92: the paperweight 

The image of those old-fashioned horrors strangely haunted 
our poet. I have clipped from a newspaper that recently re- 
printed it an old poem of his where the souvenir shop also 
preserves a landscape admired by the tourist: 

Mountain View 

Between the mountain and the eye 
The spirit of the distance "draws 
A veil of blue amorous gauze, 

The very texture of the sky.

calculations in regard to five minutes, i.e, three hundred

seconds, since J do not see how 480 can be divided by 300 or 
vice versa, but perhaps I am only tired. On the day (July 4) 
John Shade wrote this, Gradus the Gunman was getting ready 
to leave Zembla for his steady blunderings through two hemi- 
spheres (see note to line 181). 

Line 130: I never bounced a ball or swung a bat 

Frankly I too never excelled in soccer and cricket; I am a 
passable horseman, a vigorous though unorthodox skier, a 
good skater, a tricky wrestler, and an enthusiastic rock- 
climber. 

Line 130 is followed in the draft by four verses which Shade 
discarded in favor of the Fair Copy continuation (line 131 
etc.). This false start goes: 

As children play ins; in a cattle find 

In some old closet full of toys, behind 

The animals and masks, a sliding door 

[four words heauly crossed out] a seciet corriaor — 

The comparison hus remained suspended. Presumably our 
poet intended to attach it to the account of his stumbling upon 
some mysterious truth in the fainting fits of his boyhood, I 
cannot say how sorry I am that he rejected these lines. I regret 
it not onlv because of their intrinsic beauty, which is great, but 
also because the image they contain was suggested by some- 
thing Shade had from me. I h «ve ahead) alluded m the course 
of these notes to the adventures of Charles Xavier, last King of 
Zembla, and to the keen interest my friend took m the many 
stories I told him about that king. The index card on which 
the variant has been pieserved is datea July 4 and is a direct 
echo of our sunset rambles in the fragrant lanes of New Wye 
and Dulwich. “Tell me more,” he would say as he knocked his 
pipe empty against a beech trunk, and while the colored cloud 
lingered, and while far away m the lighted house on the hill 
Mrs. Shade sat quietly enjoying a video drama, I gladly ac- 
ceded to my friend’s request. 

In simple words I described the curious situation in which 
the King found himself during the first months of the rebel- 
lion. He had the amusing feeling of his being the only black 
piece in what a composer of chess problems might term a 
king-in-the*corner waiter of the solus rex type. The Royalists,

m at least the Modems (Moderate Democrats), might have 
still prevented the state from turning into a commonplace 
modern tyranny, had they been able to cope with the tainted 
gold and the robot troops that a powerful police state from 
its vantage ground a few sea miles away was pouring into 
the Zemblan Revolution. Despite the hopelessness of the sit- 
uation, the King refused to abdicate. A haughty and morose 
captive, he was caged in his rose-stone palace from a corner 
turret of which one could make out with the help of field 
glasses lithe youths diving into the swimming pool of a fairy 
tale sport club, and the English ambassador in old-fashioned 
flannels playing tennis with the Basque coach on a clay court 
as remote as paradise. How serene were the mountains, how 
tenderly painted on the western vault of the sky! 

Somewhere in the mist of the city there occurred every day 
disgusting outbursts of violence, arrests and executions, but 
the great city rolled on as smoothly as ever, the cafes were 
full, splendid plays were being performed at the Royal 
Theater, and it was really the palace which contained the 
strongest concentrate of gloom. Stone-faced, square-shoul- 
dered komizars enforced strict discipline among the troops on 
duty within and without. Puritan prudence had scaled up the 
wine cellars and removed all the maid servants from the south- 
ern wing. The ladies in waiting had, of course, left long before, 
at the time the King exiled his Queen to her villa on the 
French Riviera. Thank heavens, she was spared those dread- 
ful days in the polluted palace 1 

The door of every room was guarded. The banqueting hall 
had three custodians and as many as four loafed in the library 
whose dark recesses seemed to harbor all the shadows of 
treason. The bedrooms of the few remaining palace attendants 
had each its armed parasite, drinking forbidden rum with an 
old footman or taking liberties with a young page. And in the 
great Heralds’ Hall one could always be sure of finding ribald 
jokers trying to squeeze into the steel panoply of its hollow 
knights. And what a smell of leather and goat in the spacious 
chambers once redolent of carnations and lilacs! 

This tremendous company consisted of two main groups: 
ignorant, ferocious-looking but really quite harmless con- 
scripts from Thule, and taciturn, very polite Extremists from 
the famous Glass Factory where the revolution had flickered 
first. One can now reveal (since he is safe in Paris) that this

contingent included at least one heroic royalist so virtuosically 
disguised that he made his unsuspecting fellow guards look like 
mediocre imitators. Actually Odon happened to be one of the 
most prominent actors in Zembla and was winning applause 
in the Royal Theater on his off-duty nights. Through him the 
King kept in touch with numerous adherents, young nobles, 
artists, college athletes, gamblers, Black Rose Paladins, mem- 
bers of fencing clubs, and other men of fashion and adventure. 
Rumors rumbled. It was said that the captive would soon be 
tried by a special court; but it was also said that he would be 
shot while ostensibly being transported to another place of 
confinement. Although flight was discussed daily, the schemes 
of the conspirators had more aesthetic than practical value. A 
powerful motorboat had been prepared in a coastal cave near 
Blawick (Blue Cove) m western Zembla, beyond the chain of 
tall mountains which separated the city from the sea; the 
imagined reflections of the trembling transparent water on 
rock wall and boat were tantalizing, but none of the schemers 
could suggest how the King could escape irom his castle and 
pass safely through its fortifications. 

One August day, at the beginning of his third month of 
luxurious captivity in the South West Tower, he was accused 
of using a fop’s hand mirror and the sun’s cooperative rays to 
flash signals from his lofty casement. The vastness of the view 
it commanded was denounced not only as conducive to treach- 
ery but as producing in the surveyor an aiiy sense of supe- 
riority over his low-lodged jailers. Accordingly, one evening 
the King’s cot-and-pot were transferred to a dismal lumber 
room on the same side of the palace but on its first floor. Many 
years before, it had been the dressing room of his grandfather, 
Thurgus the Third. After Thurgus died (in 1900) his ornate 
bedroom was transformed into a kind of chapel and the 
adjacent chamber, shorn of its full-length multiple mirror and 
green silk sofa, soon degenerated into what it had now re- 
mained for half a century, an old hole of a room with a locked 
trunk in one corner and an obsolete sewing machine in an- 
other. It was, reached from a marble-flagged gallery, running 
along its north side and sharply turning immediately west of 
it to form a vestibule in the southwest corner of the Palace, 
The only window gave on an inner court on the south side.

coming and going. Above the closet, Iris Aebt squared her 
shoulders and looked away. A cricket cricked. The bedside 
light was just strong enough to put a bright gleam on the gilt 
key in the lock of the closet door. And all at once that spark on

prisoner’s mind. 

We shall now go back from mid-August 1958 to a certain 
afternoon in May three decades earlier when he was a dark 
strong lad of thirteen with a stiver ring on the forefinger of his 
Min-tanncd hand. Queen Blenda, his mother, had recently left 
for Vienna and Rome. He had several dear playmates but none 
could compete with Oleg, Duke of Rahl. In those days growing 
boys ot high-born families wore on festive occasions— of 
which we had so many during our long northern spring — 
sleeveless |eisc)s, white anklesocks with black buckle shoes, 
and very tight, very \hort shorts called hotinguens. I wish I 
could provide the reader with cut-out figures and parts of at- 
tire as given in paper-doll charts tor children armed with 
scissors. It would biighten a little these dark evenings that are 
destroying my brain. Both lads were handsome, long-legged 
spec’mens of Varangian boyhood. At twelve, Oleg was the 
best center forward at the Ducal School. When stripped and 
shiny in the mist ot the bath house, hi9 bold virilia contrasted 
harshly with his girlish grace. He was a regular faunlet. On 
that partieuLi afternoon a copious shower lacquered the 
spring foliage of the palace garden, and oh, how the Persian 
lilacs m riotous bloom tumbled and tossed behind the green- 
streaming, amethyst-blotched windowpancs! One would have 
to play indoors. Oleg was late. Would he come at all? 

It occurred to the young Prince to disinter a set of precious 
toys (the gift of a foreign potentate who had recently been 
assassinated) which had amused Oleg and him during a 
previous Easter, and then had been laid aside as happens with 
those special, artistic playthings which allow their bubble of 
pleasure to yield all its tang at once before retreating into 
museum oblivion. What he particularly desired to rediscover 
now was an elaborate toy circus contained in a box as big as a 
croquet case. He craved for it; his eyes, his brain, and that in 
his brain which corresponded to the ball of this thumb, vividly 
remembered the brown boy acrobats with spangled nates, an 
elegant and melancholy clown with a rufl, and especially three 
pup-sized elephants of polished wood with such versatile joints

that you could make the sleek jumbo stand upright on one 
foreleg or rear up solidly on the top of a small white barrel 
ringed with red. Less than a fortnight had passed since Oleg’s 
last visit, when for the first time the two boys had been al- 
lowed to share the same bed, and the tingle of tJieir misbe- 
havior, and the foreglov of another such night, were now 
mixed in our young Print ^ with an embairassment that sug- 
gested refuge m earlier, more innocent games. 

His English tutor who, after a picnic in Mandexil Forest, 
was laid up with a sprained ankle, did not know where that 
circus might be; he advised looking lor it in an old lumber 
room at the end of the West Gallery. Thither the Prince be- 
took himself. That dusty black trunk? It looked grimly nega- 
tive. The rain was more audible here owing to the proximity 
of a prolix gutter pipe What about the closet? Its gilt key 
turned reluctantly. All three shelves and the spate beneath 
were stuffed with disparate objects’ a palette with the diegs ot 
many sunsets; a cupful of counters; an ivory backscratcher; a 
thirty-twomo edition ol hmon oi Athens translated into 
Zerablan by his uncle Conmal, the Queen’s brother; a seaside

to the pebbles and she«K in that pail- a fineer of chalk* and a 
square board with a design of interlaced figures foi some long- 
forgotten game. He was about to look elsewhere in the closet 
when on trying to dislodge a piece of black velvet, one corner 
of which had unaccount ibly got caught behind the shelf, some- 
thing gave, the shelf budged, proved removable, and revealed 
just under its farther edge, in the back of the closet, a keyhole 
to which the same gilt key was found to fit. 

Impatiently he cleared the other two shelves of all they held 
(mainly old clothes and shoes), removed them as he had done 
with the middle one, and unlocked the sliding door at the 
back of the closet. The elephants were forgotten, he stood on 
the threshold of a secret passage. Its deep darkness was total 
but something about its speluncar acoustics foretold, clearing 
its throat hollowly, great things, and he hurried to his own 
quarters to fetch a couple of flashlights and a pedometer. As 
he was returning, Oleg arrived. He carried a tulip. His soft 
blond locks had been cut since his last visit to the palace, and 
the young Prince thought: Yes, I knew he would be different. 
But when Oleg knitted his golden brows and bent close to hear 



Commentary 91 

about the discovery, the young Pnncc knew by the downy 
warmth of that crimson ear and by the vivacious nod greeting 
the proposed investigation, that no change had occurred in his 
deal bedfellow. 

As soon as Monsieur Beauchamp had sat down for a game 
of chess at the bedside of Mr. Campbell and had offered his 
raised fists to choose fiom, the young Prince took Oleg to the 
magical closet. The wary, silent, grccn-carpeted steps of an 
cscaher derobe led to a stone-paved underground passage. 
Strictly speaking it was “underground” only m brief spells 
when, after burrowiug under the southwest vestibule next to 
the lumber 100 m, it went under a series oi terraces, under the 
avenue ot birches m the io)al patk, and then under the three 
tiansverse streets. Academy Boulevard, Conolanus Lane and 
Jimon Alk&gt;, that still separated it from its final destination. 
Otherwise, m its angular and cryptic course it adapted itself 
to ihc various structures which it followed heie availing itself 
of a bulwark 10 fit in side like a pencil in the pencil hold of 
a pocket diary, tncre running through ihe cellars of a great 
mansion too nth in dark passageways to notice the stealthy 
intrusion Possibly, m the intervening vears, certain arcane 
connections had been established between the abandoned pas- 
sage and the outer world by the random repercussions ot work 
in surrounding lajuis of masonry Oi hy the blind pokings of 
time itself, for here and there magic apertures and penetra- 
tions, so nairow and deep as to drive one insane, could be 
deduced from a pool of sweet, foul ditch w ater, bespeaking a 
moat, or from a dusky odoi of earth a"d turf, marking the 
proximity of a glacis slope overhead, and at one point, where 
the passage crept through ihe basement of a huge ducal villa, 
with hothouses famous for their collections of desen flora, a 
light spread of sand momentarily changed the sound ot one’s 
tread. Oleg walked in front, his shapely buttocks encased in 
tight indigo cotton moved alertly, and his own eiect radiance, 
rather than his flambeau, seemed to illume with leaps of light 
the low ceiling and crowding walls. Behind him the young 
Prince’s electric torch played on the ground and gave a coat- 
ing of flour to the back of Oleg’s bare thighs. The air was 
musty and cold On and on went the fantastic burrow. It de- 
veloped a slight ascending grade The pedometer had tocked 
off 1,888 yards, when at last they reached the end. The magic 
key of the lumber room closet slipped with gratifying ease into

the keyhole of a green door confronting them, and would have 
accomplished the act promised by its smooth entrance, had not 
a burst of strange sounds coming from behind the door caused 
our explorers to pause. Two terrible voices, a man’s and a 
woman's, now rising to a passionate pitch, now sinking to 
raucous undertones, were exchanging insults in Gutnish as 
spoken by the fisherfolk of Western Zembla. An abominable 
threat made the woman shriek out in fright. Sudden silence 
ensued, presently broken by the man’s murmuring some brief 
phrase of casual approval (“Perfect, my dear,” or “Couldn’t 
be better”) that was more eerie than anything that had come 
before. 

Without consulting each other, the young Prince and his 
friend veered in absurd panic and, with the pedometer beat- 
ing wildly, raced back the way they had come. “Oufi” said 
Oleg once the hst shell had been replaced. “You’ie all chalkv 
behind,” said the young Pnnce as they swung upstairs. They 
found Beauchamp and Campbell ending their game in a draw. 
It w r as near dinner time. The two lads were told to wash their 
hands. The recent thrill of adventure had been supciseded al- 
ready by another sort of excitement. They locked themselves 
up. The tap ran unheeded. Both were m e manly state and 
moaning like doves. 

This detailed recollection, whose structure and maculation 
have taken some time to describe in this note, skimmed 
through the King's memory in one instant Certain creatures 
of the past, and this was one of them, may he dormant for 
thirty yeaTS as this one had, while their natural habitat un- 
dergoes calamitous alterations. Soon after the discovery of the 
secret passage he almost died of pneumonia. In his delirium 
he would strive one moment to follow a luminous disk probing 
an endless tunnel and try the next to clasp the melting 
haunches of his fair angle. To recuperate he was sent for a 
couple of seasons to southern Europe. The death of Oleg at 
fifteen, in a toboggan accident, helped to obliterate the reality 
of their adventure. A national revolution was needed to make 
that secret passage real again. 

Having satisfied himself that the guard’s creaky steps had 
moved some distance away, the King opened the closet. It was 
empty now, save for the tiny volume of Timon Afimkert still 
lying in one corner, and for some old sport clothes and gym- 
nasium shoes crammed into the bottom compartment. The 



Commentary 93 

footfalls were now coming back. He did not dare pursue his 
examination and relocked the closet door. 

It was evident he would need a few moments of perfect 
security to perform with a minimum of noise a succession of 
small actions: enter the closet, lock it from the inside, remove 
the shelves, open the secret door, replace the shelves, slip into 
the yawning darkness, close the secret door and lock it. Say 
ninety seconds. 

He stepped out into the gallery, and the guard, a rather 
h mdsome but incredibly stupid Extremist, immediately ad- 
vanced towards him. “I have a certain urgent desire,” said 
the King. “I want, Hal, to play the piano before going to bed.” 
Hal (if that was his name) led the way to the music room 
where, as the King knew, Odon kept vigil over the shrouded 
harp. He was a lovbrovved. buily Irishman, with a pink head 
now covered by the rakish cap of a Russki factory worker. 
The King sat down al the Bechstein and, as soon as they were 
left alone, explained briefly the situation while taking tinkling 
notes with one hand: “Never heard of any passage,” muttered 
Odon with the annoyance ot a chess player who is shown how 
he might have saved the game he has lost. Was His Majesly 
absolutely sure? His Majesty was. Did he suppose it took one 
out of the Palace? Definitely out of the PJace. 

Anyway, Odon had to leave in a few moments, being due 
to act that night m I he Merman . a tine old melodrama which 
had not been performed, he said, for at least three decades. 
* Pm quite satisfied with my own meloarama,” remarked the 
King. “Alas,” said Odon Furrowing his forehead, he slowly 
got into his leathern coat. One could do nothing tonight. If he 
asked the commandant to be left on duty, it would only pro- 
voke suspicion, and the least suspicion might be fatal. Tomor- 
row he would find some opportunity to inspect that new 
avenue of escape, ;/ it was that and not a dead end. Would 
Charlie (His Majesty) promise not to attempt anything until 
then? “But they are moving closer and closer,’ said the King 
alluding to the noise of rapping and ripping that came from 
the Picture Gallery. “Not really,” said Odon, “one inch per 
hour, maybe two. 1 must be going now,” he added indicating 
with a twitch of the eyelid the solemn and corpulent guard 
who was coming to relieve him. 

Under the unshakable but quite erroneous belief that the 
crown jewels were concealed somewhere in the Palace, the

new administration had engaged a couple of foreign experts 
(see note to line 68 1 ) to locate them. The good work had been 
going on tor a months. The two Russians, after practically 
dismantling the Council Chamber and several other rooms of 
state, had transferred their activities to that part of the gallery 
where the huge oils of Eystein had fascinated several genera* 
tions of Zemblan princes and princesses While unable to catch 
a likeness, and therefore wisely limiting himself to a con- 
ventional style of complimentary portraiture, Eystein showed 
himself to be a prodigious master of the trompe rocil in the 
depiction of various objects surrounding his dignified dead 
models and making them look even deader by contrast to the 
fallen petal or the polished panel that he rendered with such 
love and skill But in &lt;*ome ot tho&gt;e portraits Eystein had also 
resorted to a weird form of trickery: among his decorations of 
wood or wool, gold or velvet, he would mseit one which was 
really made of the material elsewhere unit ited by paint. This 
device which was apparently meant to enhance the effect of 
his tactile and ton d values had, however, somutung ignoble 
about it and disclosed not only an essential flaw m Eystein’s 
talent, but the basic fact that “reality’' is neither the subject 
nor the object of true art which ci cates its own special reality 
having nothing to do with the average “reibtv" perceived by 
the communal eve But to return to our technicians whose 
tapping is approaching along the g tilery toward the bend 
where the King and Odon stand ready to part At this spot 
hung a portrait representing a former Keeper oi the Treasure, 
decrepit Count Kernel, who was painted with fingers resting 
lightly on an embossed and emblazoned box w’hose side facing 
the spectator consisted ot an inset oblong made of real bronze, 
while upon the shaded top ot the bos, drawn m perspective, 
the artist had pictured a plate with the beautifully executed, 
twin-lobed, brainhke, halved kernel of a walnut. 

"They are in for a surprise,” murmured Odon in his mother 
tongue, while in a corner the fat guard was going through 
some dutiful, rather lonesome, rifle-butt-banging formalities. 

The two Soviet professionals could be excused for as- 
suming they would find a real receptacle behind the real 
metal. At the present moment they were about to decide 
whether to pry out the plaque or take down the picture; but 
we can anticipate a little and assure the reader that the re- 
ceptacle, an oblong hole in the wall, was there all nght; it

contained nothing, however, except the broken bits of a nut- 
shell. 

Somewhere an iron curtain had gone up, baring a painted 
one, with nymphs and nenuphars. “I shall bring you your 
flute tomorrow,” cried Odon meaningfully in the vernacular, 
and smiled, and waved, already bemisted, already receding 
into the remoteness of his Thespian world. 

The fat guard led the King back to his room and turned 
him over to handsome Hal. It was halt past nine. The King 
went to bed. The valet, a moody rascal, brought him his usual 
milk and cognac nightcap and took awav his slippers and 
dressing gown. The man was practically out of the room when 
the King commanded him to put out tht light, upon which an 
arm re-entered and a gloved hand found and turned the switch 
Distant lightning still throbbed now and then in the window. 
The King finished his drink in the dark and replaced the empty 
tumblci on the night table whore it knocked with a “subdued

thorities m case elecuicitv failed as it lately did now and then.

position like a timid novice bum-scraping down the lichened 
rocks of Mt. Kron. The dim light he discharged at last was 
now his dearest companion, Oleg’s ghost, the phantom of 
freedom. He experienced a blend of anguish and exultation, a 
kind of amorous joy, the like of which be had last known on 
the day of his coronation, when, as he walked to his throne, a 
few bars of incredibly rich, deep, plenteous music (whose au- 
thorship and physical soifrce he was never able to ascertain) 
struck his ear, and he inhaled the hair oil of the pretty page 
who had bent to brush a rose petal off the footstool, and by 
the light of his torch the King now saw that he was hideously 
garbed in bright red. 

The secret passage seemed to have grown more squalid. 
The intrusion of its surroundings was even more evident 
than on the day when two lads shivering in thin jerseys and 
shorts had explored it. The pool of opalescent .ditch water 
had grown in length; along its edge walked a sick bat like 
a cripple with a broken umbrella. A remembered spread of 
colored sand bore the thirty-year-old patterned imprint of 
Oleg’s shoe, as immortal as the tracks of an Egyptian child’s 
tame gazelle made thirty centuries ago on blue Nilotic bricks 
drying in the sun. And, at the spot where the passage went 
through the foundations of a museum, there had somehow 
wandered down, to exile and disposal, a headless statue of 
Mercury, conductor of souls to the Lower World, and a cracked 
krater with two black figures shown dicing under a black palm. 

The last bend of the passage, ending in the green door, 
contained an accumulation of loose boards across which the 
fugitive stepped not without stumbling. He unlocked the door 
and upon pulling it open was stopped by a heavy black dra- 
pery. As he began fumbling among its vertical folds for some 
sort of ingress, the weak light of bis torch rolled its hopeless 
eye and went out. He dropped it: it fell into muffled nothing- 
ness. The King thrust both arms into the deep folds of the 
chocolate-smelling cloth and, despite the uncertainty and the 
danger of the moment, was, as it were, physically reminded 
by his own movement of the comical, at first controlled, then 
frantic undulations of a theatrical curtain through which a 
nervous actor tries vainly to pass. This grotesque sensation, 
at this diabolical instant, solved the mystery of the passage 
evert before he wriggled at last through the drapery into the 
dimly lit, dimly cluttered lumbarkamer which had once been

Line 149: one foot upon a mountain 

The Bera Range, a two-hundrcd-mile-leng chain of rugged 
mountains, not quite reaching the northern end ot the Zem- 
blan peninsula (cut ofT basaliv by an impassable canal from 
the mainland of madness), divides it into two parts, the flour- 
ishing eastern region ot Onhava and other townships, such 
as Aros and Gnndelw od. and the much narrower western 
sfrp with its quaint fishing hamlets and pleasant beach re- 
sons. The Iv/o coasts are connected by two asphalted high- 
ways. the older one shirks difficulties by running first along 
the eastern slopes northward to Odevalla, Yeslove and Embla, 
and only then turning west at the northmosi point of the 
peninsula; the newer one, an elaborate, twisting, marvelously 
graded road, traverses the range westward from just north of 
Onhava to Bregbcrg, and is termed in tourist booklets a “scenic 
drive.” Severer! trails cross the mountains at various points 
and lead to passes none or which exceeds an altitude of five 
thousand feet; a few peaks rise some two thousand feet higher 
and retain their snow in midsummer; and from one of them, 
the highest and hardest, Mt. Glitterntin, one can distinguish 
on clear days, tar out to the east, beyond the Gult of Surprise, 
a dim iridescence which some say is Russia.

brogues. A moment later, as in a transformation act, she re- 
appeared, her yellow hair still hanging lank and loose, but the 
dirty shirt replaced by a dirty pullover, and her legs sheathed 
in corduroy pants. She was told to conduct the stranger to a 
spot from which he could easily reach the pass. A sleepy and 
sullen expression blurred whatever appeal her snub-nosed 
round face might have had for the local shepherds; but she 
complied readily enough with her father's wish. His wife was 
crooning an ancient song as she busied herself with pot and 
pan. 

Before leaving, the King asked his host, whose name was 
Griff, to accept an old gold piece he chanced to have in his 
pocket, the only money he possessed. Griff vigorously refused 
and, still remonstrating, started the laborious business of un- 
locking and unbolting two or three heavy doors. The King 
glanced at the old woman, received a wink of approval, and 
put the muted ducat on the mantelpiece, next to a violet sea- 
shell against which was propped a color print representing an 
elegant guardsman with his bare-shouldered wite — Karl the 
Beloved, as he was twenty odd years before, and his young 
queen, an angry young virgin W'ith cojl-black heir and ice- 
blue eyes. 

The stars had just faded. He followed the girl and a happy 
sheepdog up the overgrown trail that glistened with the ruby 
dew in the theatrical light of an alpine dawn. The very air 
seemed tinted and glazed. A sepulchral chill emanated from 
the sheer cliff along which the trail ascended, but on the op- 
posite precipitous side, here and there between the tops of tir 
trees growing below, gossamer gleams of sunlight w'ere be- 
ginning to weave patterns of warmth. At the next turning this 
warmth enveloped the fugitive, and a black butterfly came 
dancing down a pebbly rake. The path narrowed still more 
and gradually deteriorated amidst a jumble of boulders. The 
girl pointed to the slopes beyond it. He nodded. “Now go 
home,” he said. “I shall rest here and then continue alone.” 

He sank down on the grass near a patch ot matted elfin- 
wood and inhaled the bright air. The panting dog lay down 
at his feet. Garh smiled for the first time. Zemblan mountain 
girls are as a rule mere mechanisms of haphazard lust, and 
Garh was no exception. As soon as she had settled beside him, 
she bent over and pulled over and off her tousled bead the 
thick gray sweater, revealing her naked back and blancmangS

Peacock) t and others, — separated by narrow dim valleys with 
intercalated cotton-wool bits of cloud that seemed placed be- 
tween the receding sets of ridges to prevent their flanks from 
scraping against one another. Beyond them, in the final blue, 
loomed Mt. Glitterntin, a serrated edge of bright foil; and 
southward, a tender haze enveloped more distant ridges which 
led to one another in an endless array, through every grade of 
soft evanescence. 

The pass had been reached, granite and gravity had been 
overcome; but the most dangerous stretch lay ahead. West- 
ward a succession of heathered slopes led down to the shining 
sea. Up to this moment the mountain had stood between him 
and the gulf; now he was exposed to that arching blaze. He 
began the descent. 

Three hours later he trod level ground. Two old women 
working in an orchard unbent jn slow motion and stared after 
him. He had passed the pine groves of Boscobel and was ap- 
proaching the quay of Blawick, when a black police car turned 
out of a transverse road and pulled up next to him: “The joke 
has gone too far,” said the driver. “One hundred clowns arc 
packed in Onhava jail, and the ex-King should be among them. 
Our local prison is much too small for more kings. The next 
masquerader will be shot at sight What’s &gt;our real name, 
Charlie?” “I'm British. Fm a tourist,” said the King. “Well, 
anyway, take off that ied fufa. And the cap, Give them here.” 
He tossed the things in the back of the car and drove off. 

The king walked on; the top of his blue pajamas tucked into 
his skiing pants might easily pass for a fancy shirt. There was 
a pebble in his lett shoe but he was too fagged out to do any- 
thing about it. 

He recognized the seashore restaurant where many years 
earlier he had lunched incognito with two amusing, very 
amusing, sailors. Several heavily armed Extremists were 
drinking beer on the geranium-lined veranda, among the iou- 
tine vacationists, some of whom were busy writing to distant 
friends. Through the geraniums, a gloved hand gave the King 
a picture postcard on which he found scribbled: Proceed to 
R.C. Bon voyage! Feigning a casual stroll, he reached the end 
of the embankment. 

It was a lovely breezy afternoon with a western horizon like 
a luminous vacuum that sucked in one’s eager heart. The King, 
now at the most critical point of his journey, looked about him,

scrutinizing the few promenadcrs and trying to decide which 
of them might be police agents in disguise, ready to pounce 
upon him as soon as he vaulted the parapet and made for the 
Rippleson Caves. Only a single sail dyed a royal red marred 
with some human interest the marine expanse. Nitra and Indra 
(meaning “inner” and “outer”) &gt; two black islets that seemed 
to address each other in cloaked parley, were being photo- 
graphed from the parapet by a Russian tourist, thickset, many- 
chinned, with a general’s fleshy nape. His faded wife, wrapped 
up floatingly in a flowery echarpe , remarked in singsong Mos- 
covan “Every time J see that kind of frightful disfigurement I 
can't help thinking of Nina’s boy. War is an awful thing.” 
“War."* querier her consoit. “That must have been the ex- 
plosion at the Glass Works in 1951 — not war.” They slowly 
walked past the King in the direction he had come from. On a 
sidewalk bench, lacing the *ea, a man with his emtehes beside 
him was reading the Onhava Post which featured on the first 
page Odon in an Extremist uniform and Odon in the part of 
the Merman Incredible as it may seem the palace guard had 
never realized that identity before. Now a goodly sum was 
oflered for his capture. Rhythmically the waves lapped the 
shingle. The newspaper reader’s face had been atrociously in- 
jured in the recently mentioned explosion, and ail the art of 
plastic surgery had only icsultcd in a hideous tessellated tex- 
ture with parts of pattern and parts ot outline seeming to 
change, to fuse or to separate, like fluctuating cheeks and chins 
in a distortive mirror. 

The short stretch of beach between the restaurant at the be- 
ginning of the promenade and the granite rocks at its end was 
almost empty: far to the left three fishermen were loading a 
rowboat with kelp-brown nets, and directly under the side- 
walk, an elderly woman wearing a polka-dotted dress and 
having for headgear a cocked newspaper (Ex-King Sfen — ) 
sat knitting on the shingle with her back to the street. Her 
bandaged legs were stretched out on the sand; on one side of 
her lay a pair of carpet slippers and on the other a ball of red 
wool, the leading filament of which she would tug at every 
now and then with the immemorial elbow jerk of a Zemblan 
knitter to give a turn to her yarn clew and slacken the thread. 
Finally, on the sidewalk a little girt in a ballooning skirt was 
clumsily but energetically clattering about on roller skates.

Line 171: A great conspiracy 

For almost a whole year after the King’s escape the Ex- 
tremists remained convinced that he and Odon had not left 
Zembla. The mistake can be only ascribed to the streak of 
stupidity that fatally runs through the most competent tyranny. 
Airborne machines and everything connected with them cast a 
veritable spell over the minds of our new rulers whom kind 
history had suddenly given a boxful of these zipping and 
zooming gadgets to plan with. That an important fugitive 
would not perform by air the act of fleeing seemed to them in- 
conceivable. Within minutes after the King and the actor had 
clattered down the backstairs of the Royal Theater, every wing 
in the sky and on the ground had been accounted lor — such 
was the efficiency of the government. During the next weeks 
not one private or commercial plane was allowed to take off, 
and the inspection of transients became so rigorous and 
length) that international lines decided to cancel stopovers at 
Onhava. rherc were some casualties A crimson balloon was 
enthusiastically shot down and the aeronaut (a well-known 
meteorologist) drowned in the Gulf of Surprise A pilot from 
a 1 apland &gt;»ase flying on a mission oi mercy got lost in the fog 
and was so badly harassed by Zemblan fighters that he settled 
atop a mountain peak. Some excuse tor all this could be found. 
The illusion of the King s presence in the wilds ot Zembla was 
kept up by royalist plotters who decoyed entire regiments into 
searching the mountains and woods ot our rugged peninsula. 
The government spent a ludicrous amount ot energy on 
solemnly screening the hundreds of impostors packed in the 
country’s jails. Most of them clowned their vay back to free- 
dom; a few, alas, fell. 1 hen, in the spring of the following year, 
a stunning piece ot news came from abroad. The Zemblan 
actor Odon was dnecting the making ot o cinema picture in 
Pans! 

It was now correctly conjectured that it Odon had fled, the 
King had fled too. At an extraordinary session ot the Extremist 
government there was passed from hand to hand, in grim 
silence, a copy of a French newspaper with the headline: 
L’ex-roi de Zembla est-ti a P*ris? Vindictive exasperation 
rather than state strategy moved the secret organization of 
which Gradus was an obscure member to plot the destruction 
of the royal fugitive. Spiteful thugs! They may be compared to 



108 P A L E F I R E 

hoodlums who itch to torture the invulnerable gentleman 
whose testimony clapped them in prison for life. Such con- 
victs have been known to go beserk at the thought that their 
elusive victim whose very testicles they crave to twist and tear 
with their talons, is sitting at a pergola feast on a sunny island 
or fondling some pretty young creature between his knees in 
serene security — and laughing at theml One supposes that no 
hell can be worse than the helpless rage they experience as the 
awareness of that implacable sweet mirth reaches them and 
suffuses them, slowly destroying their brutish brains. A group 
of especially devout Extremists calling themselves the Shadows 
had got together and swore to hunt down the King and kill him 
wherever he might be. They were, in a sense, the shadow twins 
of the Karlists and indeed several had cousins or even brothers 
among the followers of the King. No doubt, the origin of 
cither group could be traced to various reckless lituals in stu- 
dent fraternities and military clubs, and their development 
examined in terms of fads and anti-fads; but whereas an ob- 
jective historian associates a romantic and noble glamor with 
Karlism, its shadow group must strike one as something defi- 
nitely Gothic and nasty. The grotesque figure of Gradus, a 
cross between bat and crab, was not much odder than many 
other Shadows, such as, for example, Node, Odon’s epileptic 
half brother who cheated at cards, 01 a mad Mandevil who 
had lost a leg in trying to make anti-matter. Gradus had long 
been a member ot all sorts of jejune leftist organizations. He 
had never killed, though coming rather close to it several times 
in his gray lite. He insisted later that when he found himself 
designated to track down and murder the King, the choice was 
decided by a show ot cards — but let us not forget that it w r as 
Nodo who shuffled and dealt them out. Perhaps our man’s 
foreign origin secretly prompted a nomination that would not 
cause any son of Zembla to incur the dishonor of actual 
regicide. We can well imagine the scene: the ghastly neon 
lights of the laboratory, in an annex of the Glass Works, where 
the Shadows happened to hold their meeting that night; the 
ace of spades lying on the tiled floor; the vodka gulped down 
out of test tubes; the many hands clapping Gradus on his 
round back, and the dark exultation of the man as he received 
those rather treacherous congratulations. We place this fatidic 
moment at 0:05, July 2, 1959 — which happens to be also the 



Commentary 109 

date upon which an innocent poet penned the first lines of hia 
last poem. 

Was Gradus really a suitable person for the job? Yes and 
no. One day in his early youth, when he worked as messenger 
boy for a large and depressing firm of cardboard box manu- 
facturers, he quietly helped three companions to ambush a 
local lad whom they wished to beat up for winning a motor- 
cycle at a fair. Young Gradus obtained an axe and directed the 
felling of a tree: it crashed improperly, though, not quite 
blocking the country lane down which their carefree prey used 
to ride in the growing dusk. The poor lad whizzing along to- 
ward the spot where those roughs crouched was a slim deli- 
cate-luoking Lorrainer, and one must have been vile indeed to 
begrudge him his harmless enjoyment. Curiously enough, while 
they were lying in wait, our future iegicide fell asleep in a 
ditch and thus missed the brief alfray during which two of the 
attackers were knucklcdusted and knocked out by the brave 
Lorrainer, and the third run over and crippled for life. m 

Gradus never became a real success in the glass business to 
which he turned again and again between his wine-selling and 
pamphlet-printing jobs. He started as a maker of Cartesian 
devils — imps ol bottle glass bobbing up and down in methylate- 
filied tubes hawked during Catskin Week on the boulevards. 
He also worked as teazer, and later as flasher, at governmental 
factories — and was, I believe, more or less responsible for the 
remarkably ugly red-and-amber windows in the great public 
lavatory at rowdy but colorful Kalixhaven where the sailors 
are. He claimed to have improved the glitter and rattle of the 
so-called feuilles-d'alarme used by grape growers and orchard- 
men to scare the birds. 1 have staggered the notes referring to 
him in such a fashion that the first (see note to line 17 where 
some of his other activities are adumbrated) is the vaguest 
while those that follow become gradually clearer as gradual 
Gradus approaches in space and time. 

Mere springs and coils produced the inward movements of 
our clockwork man. He might be termed a Puritan. One es- 
sential dislike, formidable in its simplicity, pervaded his dull 
soul: he disliked injustice and deception. He disliked their 
union — they were always together — with a wooden passion 
that neither had, nor needed, words to express itself. Such a 
dislike should have deserved praise had it not been a by- 



110 


PALE FIRE 


product of the man’s hopeless stupidity. He called unjust and 
deceitful everything that surpassed his understanding. He wor- 
shiped general ideas and did so with pedantic aplomb. The 
generality was godly, the specific diabolical. If one person was 
poor and the other wealthy it did not matter what precisely 
had ruined one or made the other rich: the difference itself was 
unfair, and the poor man who did not denounce it was as 
wicked as the rich one who ignored it. People who knew too 
much, scientists, writers, mathematicians, crystalographers and 
so forth, were no better than kings or priests: they all held an 
unfair share of power of which others were cheated. A plain 
decent fellow should constantly be on the watch tor some piece 
of clever knavery on the part of nature and neighbor. 

The Zemblan Revolution provided Gradus with satisfac- 
tions but also produced frustrations. One highly irritating 
episode seems retrospectively most significant as belonging to 
an order of things that Gradus should have learned to expect 
but never did. An especially brilliam impersonator of the 
King, the tennis ace Julius Steinmann (son ot the well-known 
philanthropist), had eluded for several months the police who 
had been driven to the limits of exasperation by his mimicking 
to perfection the voice of Charles the Beloved m a series of 
underground radio speeches deriding the government. When 
finally captured he was tried bv a special commission, of 
which Gradus was member, and condemned to death. The 
firing squad bungled their job, and a little later the gallant 
young man was found recuperating trom bis wounds at a 
provincial hospital. W hen Gradus learned of this, he flew into 
one of his rare rages — not because the fact presupposed 
royalist machinations, but because the clean, honest, ordeily 
course of death had been interfered with m an unclean, dis- 
honest, disorderly manner. Without consulting anybody he 
rushed to the hospital, stormed in, located Julius in a crowded 
ward and managed to fire twice, both times missing, before the 
gun was wrested from him by a hefty male nulse. He rushed 
back to headquarters and returned with a dozen soldiers but 
his patient had disappeared. 

Such things rankle — but what can Gradus do? The huddled 
fates engage in a great conspiracy against Gradus. One notes 
with pardonable glee that his likes are never granted the ulti- 
mate thrill of dispatching their victim themselves. Oh, surely, 
Gradus is active, capable, helpful, often indispensable. At the 



Commentary 111 

foot of the scaffold, on a raw and gray morning, it is Gradus 
who sweeps the night’s powder snow off the narrow steps; but 
his long leathery face will not be the last one that the man who 
must mount those steps is to see in this world. It is Gradus who 
buys the cheap fiber valise that a luckier guy will plant, with a 
time bomb inside, under the bed of a former henchman. No* 
body knows better than Gradus how to set a trap by means of 
a fake advertisement, but the rich old widow whom it hooks is 
courted and slain by another. When the fallen tyrant is tied, 
naked and howling, to a plank in the public square and killed 
piecemeal by the people who cut slices out, and eat them, and 
distribute his living body among themselves (as I read when 
young in a storv about an Italian despot, which made of me a 
vegetarian for life), Gradus docs not take part in the infernal 
sacrament: he points out the right instrument and directs the 
carving. 

All this is as it should be; the world needs Gradus. But 
Gradus should not kill kings. Vinogradus should never, ne^er 
provoke God. Leningradus should not aim his pea-shooter at 
people even in dreams, because if he does, a pair of colossally 
thick, abnormally hairy arms will hug him fiom behind and 
squeeze, squeeze, squeeze. 

Lira 17?: books and people 

In a black pocketbook that f fortunately have with me I 
find, jotted down, heie and there, among various extracts that 
had happened to please me (a footnote from Boswell’s Life of 
Dr. Johnson , the inenptious on the trees in Wordsraith’s 
famous avenue, a quotation from St. Augustine, and so on), a 
few samples of John Shade’s convention which 1 had col- 
lected in order to refer to them in the presence of people 
whom my friendship with the poet might interest or annoy. 
His and my reader will, 1 trust, excuse r.ie for breaking the 
orderly course of these comments and letting my illustrious 
friend speak for himself. 

Book reviewers being mentioned, he said: “I have never 
acknowledged piinted piaise though sometimes I longed to 
embrace the glowing image of this or that paragon of discern- 
ment; and I have never bothered to lean out of my window 
and empty my skoramis on some poor hack’s pate. I regard 
both the demolishment and the rave with like detachment.” 
Kinbote: “I suppose you dismiss the firsd as the blabber of a

blockhead and the second as a kind soul’s friendly act?” Shade: 
"‘Exactly.” 

Speaking of the Head of the bloated Russian Department, 
Ptof. Pnin, a regular martinet in regard to his underlings 
(happily, Prof. Botkin, who taught in another department, 
was not subordinated to that grotesque “perfectionist”) : “How 
odd that Russian intellectuals should lack all sense of humor 
when they have such marvelous humorists as Gogol, Dostoev- 
ski, Chekhov, Zoshchenko, and those joint authors of genius 
Ilf and Petrov.” 

Talking of the vulgarity of a certain burly acquaintance of 
ours: “The man is as corny as a cook-out chef apron.” Kin- 
bote (laughing) : “Wonderful!” 

The subject ol teaching Shakespeare at college level having 
been introduced: “First of all, dismiss ideas, and social back- 
ground, and train the freslinian to shiver, to get drunk on the 
poetry of Hamlet or Lear , to read with his spine and not with 
his skull.” Kmbote: “You appreciate particularly the purple 
passages?” Shade: “Yes, my dear Charles, I roll upon them as 
a grateful mongrel on a spot of turf loulcd by a Great Dane.” 

The respective impacts and penetrations of Marxism and 
Freudism being talked of, I said: “The worst of two false 
doctrines is alwavs that which is harder to eradicate.” Shade* 
“No, Charlie, there are simpler criteria: Marxism needs a 
dictator, and a dictator needs a secret police, and that is the 
end of the world; but the Freudian, no matter how stupid, can 
still cast his vote at the poll, even if he is pleased to call it 
(smiling] political pollination 

Of students’ papers: “I am generally very benevolent [said 
Shade]. But there are certain trifles I do not forgive.” kinbote: 
“For instance?” “Not having read the requited hook. Having 
read it like an idiot, looking in it for symbols: example: ‘The 
author uses the striking image green Laves because green is 
the symbol ot happiness and frustration.’ Iam also in the habit 
of lowering a student’s mark catastrophically if he uses ‘simple’ 
and ‘sincere’ in a commendatory sense; examples: ‘Shelley’s 
style is always very simple and good’; or ‘Yeats is always sin- 
cere.’ This is widespread, and when I hear a critic speaking of 
an author’s sincerity I know that either the critic or the author 
is a fool.” Kinbote: “But I am told this manner of thinking is 
taught in high school?” “That’s where the broom should begin 
to sweep. A child should have thirty specialists to teach him 



Commentary 1 13 

thirty subjects, and not one harassed schoolmarra to show him 
a picture of a rice field and tell him this is China because she 
knows nothing about China, or anything else, and cannot tell 
the difference between longitude and latitude.” Kinbote: M Ye*. 
1 agree.” 

Line 181. Today 

Namely, July 5, 1959, 6th Sunday after Trinity. Shade be- 
gan writing Canto Two '‘early in the moiniug” (thus noted at 
the top of Card 14). He continued (down to line 208) on and 
off throughout the day. Most ot the evening and a part of the 
night were devoted to what his favorite eighteenth-century 
writes have termed “the Bustle and Vanity of the World.”

As to my own activities, they were I am afraid most un-

him, in my powerful Kramler, all the way to his parents* 
estate, a little matter of two hundred miles. In the course of an 
all-night party, among crowds of strangers — young people, old 
people, cloyingly perfumed girls — in an atmosphere of fire- 
works, barbecue smoke, horseplay, jazz music, and auroral 
swimming, I lost all contact with the silly boy, was made to 
dance, was made to sing, got involved in the most boring 
bibble-babble imaginable with various relatives of the child, 
and finally, in some inconceiv *ble manner, found myself trans- 
ported to a different party on a diffeient estate, where, after 
some indescribable parlor games, in which my beard was 
nearly snipped off, I had a fruit-and-rice breakfast and was 
taken by my anonymous host, a drunken old fool in tuxedo 
and riding breeches, on a stumbling round ol his stables. Upon 
locating my Car (off the road, in a pine grove), J tossed out of 
the driver’s seat a pair of soggy swimming trunks and a girls 
silver slipper. The brakes had aged overnight, and 1 soon ran 
out of gas on a desolate stretch of road. Six o’clock was being 
chimed by the clocks of Wordsmith College, when l reached 
Arcady, swearing to myself never to be caught like that again 
and innocently looking forward to the solace of a quiet eve- 
ning with my poet. Only when I saw the beribboned flat carton 
I had placed on a chair in my hallway did ] realize that I had 
almost missed hi&lt;* birthdav. 

Some time ago 1 bad noticed that date on the jacket of one 
of his books; had pondeicd the awful decrepitude of his 
breakfast attire; had playfully measured my arm against his; 
and had bought for him m Washington an utterly goigeous silk 
dressing gown, a veritable dragon skin of oriental chronus, fit 
for a samurai; and this was what the carton contained. 

Hurriedly I shed my clothes and, roaring my favorite hymn, 
took a shower. My versatile gardener, while administering to 
me a much-needed rubdown, informed me that the Shades 
were giving that night a big “buffet” dinner, and that Senator 
Blank (an outspoken statesman very much in the news and a 
cousin of John’s) was expected. 

Now there is nothing a lonesome man relishes more than an 
impromptu biithday party, and thinking — nay, feeling certain 
—that my unattended telephone had been ringing all day, I 
blithely dialed the Shades’ number, and of course it was Sybil 
who answered. 

“Bon soir, Sybil.”

of their ceremonial duties, in light and shadow, and from win- 
dow to window, where like Martians the martinis and high- 
balls cruised, the two white-coated youths from the hotel 
school, and realized that I knew well, quite well, the slighter of 
the two. And finally, at half past eight (when, I imagine, the 
lady of the house had begun to crack her finger joints as was 
her impatient wont) a long black limousine, officially glossy 
and rather funereal, glided into the aura of the drive, and 
while the fat Negro chauffeur hastened to open the car door, 
I saw, with pity, my poet emerge from his house, a white 
flower in his buttonhole and a grin of welcome on his liquor- 
flushed face. 

Next morning, as soon as I saw Sybil drive away to fetch 
Ruby the maid who did not sleep in the house, I crossed over 
with the prettily and reproachfully wrapped up carton. In 
front of their garage, on the ground, I noticed a buchmann , a 
little pillar of library books which Sybil had obviously for- 
gotten there I bent towards them under the incubus of curi- 
osity: they were mostly by Mr. Faulkner; and the next moment 
Sybil was back, her tires scrunching on the gravel right behind 
me. I added the hooks to my gift and placed the whole pile in 
her lap. That was nice ot me — but what was that carton? Just 
a present for John. A present? Well, was it not his birthday 
yesterday? Yes, it was, but after all are noi birthdays mere 
conventions? Conventions or not, but it w T as my birthday too 
— small difference ot sixteen years, that’s all. Oh my! Con- 
gratulations. And how did the party go? Well, you know what 
such parties are (here I reached in my pocket for another 
book — a book she did not expect). Yes, what aie thev? Oh, 
people whom you’ve known all your life and simply must in- 
vite once a year, men like Ben Kaplun and Dick Colt with 
whom we went to school, and that Washington cousin, and the 
fellow whose novels you and John think so phony. We did not 
ask you because we knew how tedious you find such affairs. 
This was my cue. 

“Speaking of novels,” I said, “you remember we decided 
once, you, your husband and I, that Proust’s rough master- 
piece was a huge, ghoulish fairy tale, an asparagus dream,

let me finish sweetly — we were wrong, Sybil, we were wrong 
in denying our little beau tenebreux the capacity of evoking

eighteenth-centuryish, or even seventeenth-century ish, brand, 
but it is there. Please, dip or redip, spider, into his book

I am a very sly Zemblan. Just in case , 1 had brought wim 
me in my pocket the third and last volume of the Bibliotheque 
de la Pltiade edition, Paris, 1954, of Proust's work, wherein I 
had marked certain passages on pages 269-271, Mme. de Morte- 
mart, having decided ihat Mme. de Valcourt would not be 
among the “elected” at her soiree, intended to send her a note 
on the next day saying “Dear Edith, I miss you, last night 1 
did not expect you too much (Edith would wonder: how could 
she at all, since she did not invite me?) because I know you 
are not overfond of this sort of parties which, if anything, 
bore you.” 

So much for John Shade’s last birthday.

that lasted for nearly a month Initiallj , one g ifbc rs, the pol- 
tergeist meart to impregnate the disturbance with the identity 
of Aunt Maud who fnd just died, the first object to perform 
was the basket in which she had once kept her half-paralv7cd 
Skye terrier (the breed called in our country “weeping-willow 
dog”). Sybil had had the animal destroyed soon after its 
mistress's hospitalization, incurring the wrath of Hazel who 
was beside herself with distress One morning this basket shot 
out of the “intact” sanctuary (see lines 90-98) and traveled 
along the corridor past the open dooi of the study, where 
Shade was at work he saw it whizz by and spill its humble 
contents* a ragged coverlet, a rubber bone, and a partly dis- 
colored cushion Next day the scene of action switched to the 
dining room where one of Aunt Maud’s oils (Cypress and 



Commentary 119 

Bat) was found to be turned toward the wall Other incidents 
followed, such as short flights accomplished by her scrapbook 
(see note to line 90) and, of course, ah kinds of knockmgs, 
especially m the sanctuary, which would rouse Hazel from her, 
no doubt, peaceful sltcp in the adjacent bedroom But soon the 
poltergeist ran out of ideas in connection with Aunt Maud 
and became, as it weie, more eclectic All the banal motions 
that object^ .ire limited to m such cases, were gone through in 
this one Saucepans crashed in the kitchen, a snowball was 
found (perhaps, prematurely) in the icebox, once or twice 
Sybil saw a plate sail bv like a discus and land safely on the 
sofa: lamps kept lighting up m vanou* pirts of the house, 
uiair^ waddled awa\ to assemble in the impassable pantry; 
my*teriou r bit° ot string were found on the floor, invisible

bitter blast, that colossus ot cold air that blows on our eastern 
shores thioughout March, and then one morning you hear the 
birds, and the flags hang flaccid, and the outlines of the world 
are again in place. The phenomena ceased completely and 
were, if not forgotten, at least never referred to; but how 
curious it is that we do loX perceive a mysterious sign of 
equation between the Hercules springing forth from a neurotic 
child’s weak frame and the boisterous ghost ot Aunt Maud; 
how curious that our rationality feels satisfied when we plump 
for the first explanation, though, actually, the scientific and

confronted by too much vanctv with nothing to help logic 
choose and so left a bhnk, rel\mg upon the mysterious organic 
force that rescues poets to fill it in at its own convenience 9 Or 
was there something else — some obscure intuition, some pro- 
phetic scruple that prevented him from spelling out the name 
of an eminent man who happened to be an intimate friend of 
his? Was he perhaps playing safe because a reader in his 
household might have objected to that paiticular name being 
mentioned? And if it comes to that, why mention it at all in 
this tragical context? Dark, disturbing thoughts.

Line 238: empty emerald case 

This, I understand, is the semitransparent envelope left on 
a tree trunk by an adult cicada that has crawled up the trunk 
and emerged. Shade said that he had once questioned a class 
of three hundred students and only three knew what a cicada 
looked like. Ignorant settlers had dubbed it “locust,” which is, 
of course, a grasshopper, and the same absurd mistake has 
been made by generations of translators of Lafontaine’s La 
Cigale et la Fourmi (see lines 243-244). The cigale's com- 
panion piece, the ant. is about to be embalmed in amber. 

Inuring our sunset rambles, of which there were so many, at

Elsewhere!) my friend Had a rather coquettish way of point- 
ing out with the tip of his cane various curious natural objects. 
jHe never tired ot illustrating by means of these examples the 
extraordinary blend of Canadian Zone and Austral Zone*&lt;hat 
“obtained/’ as he put it, in that particular spot of Appalachia 
where at our altitude of about 1 ,500 feet northern species of 
birds, insects and plants commingled with southern repre- 
sentatives As most literary celebrities. Shade did not seem to 
realize that a humble admirer who has cornered at last and 
has at last to himsell the inaccessible man of genius, is con- 
siderably mote interested in discussing with him literature and 
life than in being told that the ‘diana” (presumably a flower) 
occurs in New Wye together with the “atlantis" (presumably 
another flower), and things of that sort. I particularly remem- 
ber one exasperating evening stroll (July 6) which my poet 
granted me, with majestic generosity, in compensation for a 
bad hurt (see, frequently see, note to line Ifcl), in recompense 
for my small gift (which I do not think he ever used), and 
with the sanction of his wife who made it a point to accom- 
pany us part of the way to Dulwich Forest. By means of astute 
excursions into natural history Shade kept evading me, me, 
who was hysterically, intensely, uncontrollably curious to 
know what portion exactly ot the Zemblan king’s adventures 
he had completed in the course of the last four or five days. 
My usual shortcoming, pride, prevented rfte from pressing him 
with direct questions but I kept reverting to my own earlier 
themes — the escape from the palace, the adventures in the 
mountains — in order to force some confession from him. One

As to the Vanessa butterfly, it wilt reappear in lines 993-995

name was The Red Admirable, later degraded to The Red 
Admiral. It is one of the few butterflies i happen to be familiar 
with. ZemMans call it harvalda (the heialdic one) possibly 
because a recognizable figure of it is borne in the escutcheon 
of the Dukes of Payn. In the autumn of certain years it used 
to occur rather commonly in the Palace Gardens and visit the 
Michaelmas daisies in company with a day-flying moth. I 
have seen The Red Admirable feasting on oo/v plums and, 
once, on a dead rabbit. It is a most frolicsome fly. An almost 
tame specimen of it was the last natrnai object John Shade 
pointed out to me as he walked to his doom (see, see now, my

The scripta m question were two hundred and thirteen long 
letters which had passed some seventy years ago between 
Zule Bretwit, Oswin’s grand-uncle, Mayor of Odevalla, and 
a cousin of his, Ferz Bretwit, Mayor of Aros This corre- 
spondence, a dismal exchange of bureaucratic platitudes and 
fustian jokes, was devoid of even such parochial interest as 
letters of this «ort may possess in the eyes of a local his-

to us and we’ll be nice to you. I know your funds are some- 
what — ” (Small-fish gesture and wink). 

“True enough/’ sighed Bretwit. 

“If you go along with us it won’t cost you a centime.” 

“Oh, I could pay something ” (Pout and shrug). 

“We don’t need your money” (Traffic-stopper’s palm). “But 
here’s our plan. I have mess iges from other barons for other 
fugitives. In tact, 1 have letters for the most mysterious fugi- 
tive of all.” 

“What!” cried Bretwit in candid surprise. “The) know 
at home that His Majesty has left Zembla?” (1 could have 
spanked the dear man ) 

“Indeed, yes,” said Gradus kneading his hands, and fairly 
panting with animal pleasure — a matter ol instinct no doubt 
since the man certainly could not realize intelligently *hat 
the ex-consul’s faux pas was nothing less than the first con- 
firmation of the King’s presence abroad: “Indeed,” he re- 
peated with a meaningful leer, “and I would be deeply obliged 
to you if you would recommend me to Mr. X ” 

At these words a false truth dawned upon Oswnn Bretwil 
and he moaned to himself: Ot com sc! How obtuse of me* 
He is one of us f The fineers of his left hand involuntarily 
started to twitch as if ht were pulling a kikapoo puppet ovei 
it, while his eyes followed intently his interlocutor’s low- 
class gesture ol satisfaction. A Karlist agent, revealing himself 
to a superior, was expected to make a sien corresponding 
to the X (for Xavier) m the one-hand alphabet of deaf mutes: 
the hand held m horizontal position with the index curved 
rather flaccidly and the rest of the fingers bunched (many 
have criticized it for looking too droopy; it has now been 
replaced by a more virile combination). On the several oc- 
casions Bretwit had been given it, the manifestation had been 
preceded for him, during a moment of suspense — rather a 
gap in the texture ol time than an actual delay — by some- 
thing similar to what physicians call the aura, a strange sensa- 
tion both tense and vaporous, a hot-cold ineffable exasperation 
pervading the entire nervous system before a seizure. And 
on this occasion too Bretwit felt the magic wine rise to his 
head. 

“All right, I am ready. Give me the sign,” he avidly said. 

Gradus, deciding to risk it, glanced at the hand in Bretwit’s

doing its best to convey — mere rudiments of the required

“No, no,” said Breiwit with an indulgent smile tor the awk- 
ward novice “The other hand, my friend His Majesty is left- 
handed, you know ” 

Gradus tried again — but, hke an expelled puppet, the wild 
little prompter had disappeared Sheepishly contemplating his

is incomparably more beautiful than the much-overrated swan,

“Would he ever come ioi me?" I used to wonder waiting

Line 347 : old barn 

This barn, or rather shed, where “certain phenomena” 
occurred in October (a few months prior to Hazel 
Shade's death) had belonged to one Paul Hcntzner, an ec- 
centric farmer ot German extraction, with old-lashioned hob- 
bies such as taxidermy and herborizing Thiough an odd 
trick of atavism, he was (according to Shnle who liked to 
talk about him — the only time, mcidentalK, when m&gt; sweet 
old friend became a tiny bit ot a bore f ) a throwback to the 
“curious Germans’ 1 who three centuries aiio had been the 
fathers ot the first great naturalists. All hough bv academic 
standards an uneducated man, with no real knowledge ol far 
things in space or time, he had about him a colertul and 
earthy something that pleased John Shade much better than 
the suburban refinements of the English Department. He who 
displayed such fastidious care in his choice of lellow ramblers 
liked to trudge with the gaunt solemn German, every other 
evening, up the wood path to Dulwich, and all around his 
acquaintance’s fields Delighting as he did in the right word, 
he esteemed Heni/ner foi knowing “the names of things” — 
though some ot those names w r ere no doubt local monstrosi- 
ties, or Germanisms, or pure inventions on the old rascal’s 
part. 

Now he was walking with another companion. Limpidly 
do I remember one perfect evening when my friend sparkled 
with quips, and marrowskies, and anecdotes which I gallantly 
countered with tales of Zcrabla and harebreath escapes! As 
we were skirting Dulwich Forest, he interrupted me to indi- 
cate a natural grotto in the mossy rocks by the side of the 
path under the flowering dogwoods. This was the spot where

the good farmer invariably stopped, and once, when they hap- 
pened to be accompanied by his little boy, the latter, as he 
trotted beside them, pointed and remarked informatively: 
“Here Papa pisses ” Another, less pointless, story awaited me 
at the top of the hill, wheie a square plot invaded with willow 
herb, milkweed and ironweed, and teeming with butterflies, 
contrasted sharply with the goldenrod all around it After 
Hentzner’s wife had left him taking with her 
their child, he sold his farmhouse (now replaced by a drive-m 
cinema) and went to li\e m town, but on summer nights he 
used to take a sleeping bag to the b irn that stood at the far

that 1 prevented him from getting to the point he was con- 
fusely and self-consciously making (for as I have said in an 
earlier note, he never cared to refer to his dead child) by 
filling in a welcome pause with an extraordinary episode from 
the history of Onhava University That episode took place 
in the year of grace 1876 But to return to Hazel Shade She 
decided she wanted to investigate the “phenomena” herself 
for a paper (“on an) subject”) requited m her psychology 
course by a cunning professor who was collecting data on

PALE FIRE 


“Autoneurynological Patterns among American university stu- 
dents.” Her parents permitted her to make a nocturnal visit 
to the barn only under the condition that Jane P. — deemed 
a pillar of reliability — accompany her. Hardly had the girls 
settled down when an electric storm that was to last all night 
enveloped their refuge with such theatrical ululations and 
flashes as to make it impossible to attend to any indoor sounds 
or lights. Hazel did not give up, and a few days later asked 
Jane to come with her again, but Jane could not. She tells 
me she suggested that the White twins (nice fraternity boys 
accepted by the Shades) would come instead. But Hazel flatly 
refused this new arrangement, and after a row with her par- 
ents took her bulTs-eve and notebook and set off alone. One 
can well imagine how the Shades dreaded a recrudescence of 
the poltergeist nuisance but the ever-sagacious Dr. Sutton af- 
firmed — on what authority 1 cannot tell — that cases in which 
the same person was again involved in the same type of out- 
breaks after a lapse of six years were practically unknown. 

Jane allowed me to copv out some ot Hazel’s notes from 
a typescript based on jottings made on the spot:

The notes continue for several pages hut for obvious rea- 
sons I must renounce to give them verbatim in thin commen- 
tary. There wee long pauses and “scratches and scrapcings" 
again, and returns of the luminous circlet. She spoke to it. 
If asked something that it found deliciously silly (“Are you 
a will-o-the-wisp?”) it would dash to and fro in ecstatic nega- 
tion, and when it wanted to give a grave answer to a giave 
question (“Are you dead?”) would slowly ascend with an 
air of gathering altitude for a weighty affirmative drop. For 
brief periods of time it responded to the alphabet she recited 
by staying put until the right letter was called whereupon it 
gave a small jump of approval. But these jumps would get

Lines 347-348. She twisted words 

One of the examples her father gives is odd J am quite' 
sure it was I who one day, when we were discussing ‘'mirror 
words,” observed (and I recall the poet’s expression of stupe- 
faction) that “spider” in reverse is ‘ rcdips,” and “T. S. Eliot,” 
"toilest.” But then it is also true that Hazel Shade resembled 
me in certain respects 

Lines 367-370: then — pen, again — explain 

In speech John Shade, as a good American, rhymed “again” 
with “pen” and not with “explain.” The adjacent position of 
these rhymes is curious. 

Line 376: poem 

I believe I can guess (in my bookless mountain cave) what 
poem is meant; but without looking it up I would not wish 
to name its author. Anyway, I deplore my friend’s vicious 
thrusts at the most distinguished poets of his day.

Lines 385-386: Jane Dean, Pete Dean 

The transparent pseudonyms of two innocent people. I 
visited Jane Provost when passing through Chicago in August. 
I found her still unmarried. She showed me some amusing 
photos of her cousin Peter and his friends. She told me — 
and J have no reason to disbelieve her words — that Peter 
Provost (whom I desired very very much to meet, but he 
was, alas, selling automobiles in Detroit) might have exag- 
gerated a wee bit, but certainly did not fib, when explaining 
that he had to keep a promise made to one of his dearest 
fraternity friends, a glorious young athlete whose “garland” 
will not, one hopes, be “briefer than a girl's.” Such obliga- 
tions arc not to be treated lightly or disdainfully. Jane said 
she had tried to talk to the Shades after the tragedy, and later 
had written Sybil a long letter that was never acknowledged. 
I said, displaying a bit of the slang I had recently started to 
master: “You are telling me!” 

Lines 403-404. it’s eight fifteen (And here time forked) 

From here to line 474 two themes alternate in a synchro- 
nous arrangement: television in the Shades’ parlor and the 
replay, as it were, of Hazel’s (already adumbrated) actions 
from the moment Peter met his blind date (406-407) and 
apologized for having to leave in a hurry (420-428) io Hazel's 
ride in the bus (445-447 and 457-459), ending with the 
watchman’s finding her body (475-477). I have italicized the 
Hazel theme. 

The whole thing strikes me as too labored and long, es- 
pecially since the synchronization device has been already 
worked to death by Flaubert and Joyce. Otherwise the pattern 
is exquisite.

On July 10, the dav John Shade wrote this, and perhaps 
at the very minute he started to use his thirty-third index

from Geneva to Lex, where Odon was known to be resting, 
after completing his motion picture, at the villa of an old

in a Copenhagen store and already wrinkled. Puffing, consult- 
ing his wrist watch, and fanning himself with his trilby, also 
new, he reached at last the transverse continuation of the 
looping road he had left below. He crossed it, walked through 
a wicket and up a curving gravel path, and found himself in 
front of Lavender’s villa. Its name, Libitina, was displayed 
in cursive script above one of the barred north windows, with 
its letters made of black wire and the dot over each of the 
three i’s cleverly mimicked by the tarred head of a chalk- 
coated nail driven into the white facade. This device, and 
the north- facing window grates, Gradus had observed in Swiss 
villas before, but immunity to classical allusion deprived him 
of the pleasure he might have derived from the tribute that 
Lavender’s macabre joviality had paid the Roman goddess 
of corpses and tombs. Another matter engaged Iris attention: 
from a corner casement came the sounds of a piano, a tumult 
of vigorous music which for some odd reason, as he was to 
tell me later, suggested to him a possibility he had not con- 
sidered and caused his baud to fly to his hip pocket as he 
prepared to meet not Lavender and not Odon but that gifted 
hymnist, Charles the Beloved. The music stopped as Graduv, 
confused by the whimsical shape of the house, hesitated be- 
fore a glassed-in porch An elderly footman in green appeared 
from a green side door and led him to another entrance. 
With a show of carelessness not improved by laborious repe- 
tition, Gradus asked him, first in mediocre Lrench. then in 
worse English, and finally in fair German, it there were many 
guests stajing in the house; but the mail only smiled and 
bowed him into the music room. The musician had vanished. 
A harplike din still came from the grand piano upon which 
a pair of beach sandals stood as on the brink of a lily pond. 
From a window scat a gaunt jet- glittering lady stiffly arose 
and introduced herself as the governess of Mr. La venders 
nephew. Gradus mentioned his eagerness to see Lavender’s 
sensational collection: this aptly defined its pictures of love- 
making in orchards, but the governess (whom the King had 
always called to her pleased face Mademoiselle Belle instead 
of Mademoiselle Baud) hastened to confess her total ignorance 
of her employer’s hobbies and treasures and suggested the 
visitor’s taking a look at the garden: “Gordon will show you 
his favorite flowers” she said, and called into the next room 



Commentary 143 

“Gordon I” Rather reluctantly there came out a slender but 
strong-looking lad of fourteen or fifteen dyed a nectarine hue 
by the sun. He had nothing on save a leopard-spotted loin- 
cloth. His closely cropped hair was a tint lighter than his skin. 
His lovely bestial face wore an expression both sullen and 
sly. Our preoccupied plotter did not register any of these 
details and merely experienced a general impression of in- 
decency. “Gordon is a musical prodigy,” said Miss Baud, 
and the boy winced. “Gordon, will you show the garden to 
this gentleman?” The boy acquiesced, adding he would take 
a dip if nobody minded. He put on his sandals and led the 
way out. Through light and shade walked the strange pair: 
the graceful boy wreathed about the loins with ivy and the 
seedy killer in his cheap brown suit with a folded newspaper 
sticking out of his left-hand coat pocket. 

“That’s the Grotto,” said Gordon. “I once spent the night 
here with a friend.” Gradus let his indifferent glance enter 
the mossy recess where one could glimpse a collapsible mat- 
tress with a dark stain on its orange nylon. The boy applied 
avid lips to a pipe of spring water and wiped his wet hands 
on his black bathing trunks. Gradus consulted his watch. 
They strolled on. “You have not seen anything yet,” said 
Gordon. 

Although the house possessed at least half-a-dozen water 
closets, Mr. Lavender in fond memory of his grandfather’s 
Delaware farm, had installed a rustic privy under the tallest 
poplar of his splendid garden, and for chosen guests, whose 
sense of humor could stand it, he would unhook from the. 
comfortable neighborhood of the billiard room fireplace a 
heart-shaped, prettily embroidered bolster to take with them 
to the throne. 

The door was open and across its inner side a boy’s hand 
had scrawled in charcoal: The King was here . 

“That’s a fine visiting card,” remarked Gradus with a 
forced laugh. “By the way, where is he now, that king?” 

“Who knows,” said the boy striking his flanks clothed in 
white tennis shorts, “that was last year. I guess he was head* 
ing for the Cote d’Azur, but I am not sure.” 

Dear Gordon lied, which was nice of him. He knew per- 
fectly well that his big friend was no longer in Europe; but 
dear Gordon should not have brought up the Riviera matter

which happened to be true and the mention of which caused 
Gradus, who knew that Queen Disa had a palazzo there, to 
mentally slap his brow. 

They had now reached the swimming pool. Gradus, in 
deep thought, sank down on a canvas stool. He should wire 
headquarters at once. No nepd to prolong this visit. On the 
other hand, a sudden departure might look suspicious. The 
stool creaked under him and he looked around ior another 
seat. The young woodwose had now closed his eyes and was 
stretched out supine on the pool’s marble margin; his Tarzan 
brief had been cast aside on the turf, Gradus spat in disgust 
and walked back towards the house. Simultaneously the eld- 
erly footman came running down the steps of the terrace 
to tell him in three languages that he was wanted on the 
telephone. Mr. Lavender could not make it alter all hut would 
like to talk to Mr. Degre. After an exchange of civilities 
there was a pause and La vender asked* “Sure vou aren’t a 
mucking snooper from that French rag 0 ” “A what?” said 
Gradus, pronouncing the last word as hl vot ” *‘A mucking 
snooping son ot a bitch?” Gradus hung up. 

He retrieved his car and drove up to a higher level on the 
hillside. From the same road bay, on a misty and luminous 
September day, with the diagonal of the first silver filament 
crossing the space between two balusters, the Kang had sur- 
veyed the twinkling ripples of Lake Geneva and had noted 
their antiphonal response, the flashing of tinfoil scares in the 
hillside vineyards. Giadus as he stood there, and moodily 
looked down at the red tiles ot Lavender’s villa snuggling 
among Us protective trees, could make out, with some help 
from his betters, a pan of the lawn and a segment of the 
pool, and even distinguish a pair of sandals on its marble 
rim — all that remained of Narcissus, One assumes he won- 
dered if he should not hang around for a bit to make sure 
he had not been bamboozled. From far below mounted the 
clink and tinkle of distant masonry work, and a sudden train 
passed between gardens, and a heraldic butterfly volant en 
arriere , sable, a bend gules, traversed the stone parapet, and 
John Shade took a fresh card.

In the draft there is the lighter and more musical:

The reference is, of course, to Robert Frost (b 1874) 
The hnt displavs one of those combinations of pun and meta- 
phor at which our pott excels In the temperature charts of

Frost is the author of one of the greatest short poems in 
the English language a poem that everv American boy knows 
by heart, about the wintry woods, and the dreary dusk, and 
the little horsebells ot gentle remonstration m the dull dark- 
ening air, and that prodigious and poignant end — two closing 
lines identical in every syllable, but one personal and physical, 
and the other metaphysical and universal I dare not quote 
from memory lest I displace one small precious word

his snowflakes settle that way

the Shades spent the first part ol that year; hut here again, as 
in regard to so many lascinating facets of my friend’s past life, 
I am not in the possession of particulars (who is to blame, 
dear S.S?) and not in the position to say whethe** or not, in 
the course of possible excursions along the coast, they ever 
reached Cap Turc and glimpsed from an oleander-lined lane, 
usually open to tourists, the Ttalianate villa built b) Queen 
Disa’s grandiather in 1908, and called then Villa Paradise , or 
in Zemblan Villa Paradisa , later to forego the first hall ot its 
name in honor of his ravorite granddaughter. Fheie she spent 
the first fifteen summers of her life; thither did she return m 
1953, “tor reasons of health"’ (as impressed on the nation) 
but really, a banished queen; and there she still dwells. 

When the Zcmblan Revolution broke out (Mav 1 ), 
she wrote the King a wild letter in governess English, uigtng 
him to come and stay with her until the situation cleared up. 
The letter was intercepted by the Onhava police, translated 
into crude Zemblan by a Hindu member of the Extremist 
party, and then read aloud to the royal captive in a wouid-be 
ironic voice by the preposteious commandant of the palace. 
There happened to be in that letter one — only one, thank 
God — sentimental sentence: “I want you to know tint no 
matter how much you hurt me, you cannot hurt my love,” 
and this sentence (if we re-English it from the Zemblan) came 
out as: “I desire }ou and love when you flog me.” He inter- 
rupted the commandant, calling him a buffoon and a rogue, 
and insulting everybody around so dreadfully that the Ex- 
tremists had to decide fast whether to shoot him at once or let 
him have the original of the letter. 

Eventually he managed to inform her that he was confined 
to the palace. Valiant Disa hurriedly left the Riviera and made 
a romantic but fortunately ineffectual attempt to return to 
Zembla. Had she been permitted to land, she would have been 
forthwith incarcerated, which would have reacted on the

King’s flight, doubling the difficulties of escape. A message 
from the Karlists containing these simple considerations 
checked her progress in Stockholm, and she flew back to her 
perch in a mood of frustration and fury (mainly, I think, be- 
cause the message had been conveyed to her by a cousin of 
hers, good old Curdy Buff, whom she loathed). Several weeks 
passed and she was soon in a state of even worse agitation 
owing to rumors that her husband might be condemned to 
death. She left Cap Turc again. She had traveled to Brussels 
and chartered a plane to fly north, when another message, this 
time from Odon, came, saying that the King and he were out 
of Zembla, and that she should quietly regain Villa Disa and 
await there further news. In the autumn of the same year she 
was informed by Lavender that a man representing her hus- 
band would be coming to discuss with her certain business 
matters concerning property she and her husband jointly 
owned abroad. She was in the act of writing on the t&amp;race 
under the jacaranda a disconsolate letter to Lavender when the 
tall, sheared and bearded visitor with the bouquet of flowers- 
of-the-gods who had been watching her from afar advanced 
through the garlands of shade. She looked up — and of course 
no dark spectacles and no make-up could for a moment fool 
her 

Since her final departure from Zembla he had visited her 
twice, the last time two years before, and during that lapse of 
time her pale-skin, dark-hair beauty had acquired a new, 
mature and melancholy glow. In Zembla, where most females 
are freckled blondes, we have the saying: bclwif ivurkumpf 
wid snew ebanumf , “A beautiful woman should be like a 
compass rose of ivory with four parts of ebony.” And this was 
the trim scheme nature had followed in Disa’s case. There was 
something else, something I was to realize only when I read 
Pale Fire , or rather reread it after the first bitter hot mist of 
disappointment had cleared before my eyes. I am thinking of 
lines 261-267 in which Shade describes his wife. At the 
moment of his painting that poetical portrait, the sitter was 
twice the age of Queen Disa. I do not wish to be vulgar in 
dealing with these delicate matters but the fact remains that 
sixty-year-old Shade is lending here a well-conserved coeval 
the ethereal and eternal aspect she retains, or should retain, in 
his kind noble heart. Now the curious thing about it is that 
Disa at thirty, when last seen in September 1958, bore a

singular resemblance not, of course, to Mrs. Shade as she was 
when I met her, but to the idealized and stylized picture 
painted by the poet in those lines of Pale f ire. Actually it 
was idealized and stylized only in regard to the older woman; 
in regard to Queen Disa, as she was that afternoon on that 
blue terrace, it represented a plain unretouched likeness. I 
trust the reader appreciates the strangeness of this, because if 
he does not, there is no serwe in writing poems, or notes to 
poems, or anything at al(. 

She seemed also calmer than before, her self-control had 
improved. During the previous meetings, and throughout their 
marital life in Zembla, there had been, on her part, dreadtul 
outbursts of temper. When m the finst years ot marriage he 
had wished to cope with those blazes and blasts, trying to 
make her take a rational view ot her misfortune, he had 
found them very annoying; but gradually he learned to take 
advantage ot them and welcomed them as giving him the op- 
portunity of getting rid of her presence lor lengthening peiioch* 
of time by not calling her back after a sequence of doors had 
slammed evei moic distantly, or In leaving the palace himself 
for some rural hideout 

In the beginning ot their calamitous marriage he had 
strenuously tried to possess her but to no avail. He infomied 
her he had never made love before (which was pertewtly true 
insofar as the implied object could onl) mean one thing to 
her), upon which he was forced to endure iho ridicule ot 
having her dutiful punt} involuntarily enact the wavs of a 
courtesan with a client too young or too old, he said some- 
thing to that effect (mainly to relieve the ordeal), and she 
made an atrocious scene. He farced himselt with aphrodisiac^ 
but the anterior chaiacters of her unfortunate sex kept fatally 
putting him off One night when he tried tigei tea, and hopes 
rose high, he made the mistake of begging hei to comply with 
an expedient which she made the mistake of denouncing as 
unnatural and disgusting. Finally he told her that an old riding 
accident was incapacitating him but that a cruise with his pals 
and a lot of sea bathing would be sure to lestore his strength. 

She had recently lost both parents and had no real friend to 
turn to for explanation and advice when the inevitable rumors 
reached her; these she was too proud to discuss with her 
ladies in waiting but she read books, found out all about our 
manly Zemblan customs, and concealed her naive distress

under a great show of sarcastic sophistication. He congratu- 
lated her on her attitude, solemnly swearing that he had given ■ 
up, or at least would give up, the practices of. his youth; but' 
everywhere along the road powerful temptations stood at at- 
tention. He succumbed to them from time to time, then every 
other day, then several times daily — especially during the 
robust regime of Harfar Baron of Shalksbore, a phenomenally 
endowed young brute (whose family name, “knave’s farm,” is 
the most probable derivation of “Shakespeare”). Curdy Buff 
— as Harfar was nicknamed by his admirers — had a huge 
escort of acrobats and bareback riders, and the whole affair 
rather got out of hand so that Disa, upon unexpectedly re- 
turning from a trip to Sweden, found the Palace transformed 
into a circus. He again promised, again fell, and despite the 
utmost discretion was again caught. At last she removed to 
the Riviera leaving him to amuse himself with a band of Eton- 
collared, sweet-voiced minions imported from England. m 

What had the sentiments he entertained in regard to Disa 
ever amounted to? Friendly indifference and bleak respect. 
Not even in the first bloom of their marriage had he felt any 
tenderness or any excitement. Of pity, of heartache, there 
could be no question. He was, had always been, casual and 
heartless. But the heart of his dreaming self, both before and 
after the rupture, made ex traor dinar) 7 amends. 

He dreamed of her more often, and with incomparably more 
poignancy, than his surface-like feelings for her ivarranted; 
these dreams occurred when he least thought of her, and 
worries in no way connected with her assumed her image in 
the subliminal world as a battle or a reform becomes a bird 
of wonder in a tale for children. These heart-rending dreams 
transformed the drab prose of his feelings for her into strong 
and strange poetry, subsiding undulations of which would 
flash and disturb him throughout the day, bringing back the 
pang and the richness — and then only the pang, and then only 
its glancing reflection — but not affecting at all his attitude to- 
wards the real Disa. 

Her image, as she entered and re-entered his sleep, rising 
apprehensively from a distant sofa or goitlg in search of the 
messenger who, they said, had just passed through the dra- 
peries, took into account changes of fashion; but the Disa

of time, forever remained exactly as she looked on the day he 
had first told her he did not love her. That happened during 
a hopeless trip to Italy, in a lakeside hotel garden — roses, 
black araucarias, rusty, greenish hydrangeas — one cloudless 
evening with the mountains of the far shore swimming in a 
sunset haze and the lake all peach syrup regularly rippled with 
pale blue, and the captions of a newspaper spread flat on the 
foul bottom near the stone bank perfectly readable through 
the shallow diaphanous filth, and because, upon hearing him 
out, she sank down on the lawn in an impossible posture, 
examining a grass culm and frowning, he had taken his words 
back at once; but the shock had fatally starred the mirror, 
and thenceforth in his dreams her image was infected with 
the memory of that confession as with some disease or the 
secret aftei effects of a surgical operation too intimate to be 
mentioned. 

The gist, rather than the actual plot of the dream, was a 
constant refutation of his not loving her. His dream-love for 
her exceeded in emotional tone, m spiritual passion and depth, 
anything he had experienced in his surface existence. This love 
was like an endless wringing of hands, like a blundering of the 
soul through an infinite maze of hopelessness and remorse 
They were, in a sense, amorous dreams, for they were per- 
meated with tenderness, with a longing to sink his head onto 
her lap and sob away the monstrous past They brimmed with 
the awful awareness of her being so young and so helpless 
They were purer than his life. What carnal aura there was in 
them came not from her but from those with whom he be- 
trayed her — prickly-chinned Phryma, pretty Timandra with 
that boom under her apron — and even so the sexual scum re- 
mained somewhere far above the sunken treasure and was 
quite unimportant. He would see her being accosted by a misty 
relative so distant as to be practically featureless. She would 
quickly hide what she held and extend her arclied hand to be 
kissed. He knew she had just come across a telltale object — a 
riding boot in his bed — establishing beyond any doubt his un- 
faithfulness. Sweat beaded her pale, naked forehead — but she 
had to listen to the prattle of a chance visitor or direct the 
movements of a workman with a ladder who was nodding his

bear the sight of her automatic smile as she turned from the 
agony of the disclosure to the polite trivialities required of 
her. She would be canceling an illumination, or discussing 
hospital cots with the head nurse, or merely ordering breakfast 
for two in the sea cave — and through the everyday plainness of 
the talk, through the play of the charming gestures with which 
she always accompanied certain readymade phrases, he, the 
groaning dreamer, perceived the disarray of her soul and was 
aware that an odious, undeserved, humiliating disaster had be* 
fallen her, and that only obligations of etiquette and her 
staunch kindness to a guiltless third party gave her the force to 
smile. As one watched the light on her face, one foresaw it 
would fade in a moment, to be replaced — as soon as the visi- 
tor left — by that impossible little frown the dreamer could 
never forget. He would help her again to her feet on the same 
lakeside lawn, with parts of the lake fitting themselves into the 
spaces between the rising balusters, and presently he andlftie 
would be walking side by side along an anonymous alley, and 
he would feel she was looking at him out of the corner of a 
faint smile but when he forced himself to confront that ques- 
tioning glimmer, she was no longer there. Everything had 
changed, everybody was happy. And he absolutely had to find 
her ai once to tell her that he adored her, but the large audi- 
ence before him separated him from the door, and the notes 
reaching him through a succession of hands said that she was 
not available; that she was inaugurating a file; that she had 
married an American businessman; that she had become a 
character in a novel; that she was dead. 

No such qualms disturbed him as he sat now on the ter- 
race of her villa and recounted his lucky escape from the 
Palace. She enjoyed his description of the underground link 
with the theater and tried to visualize the jolly scramble across 
the mountains; but the part concerning Garh displeased her as 
if, paradoxically, she would have preferred him to have gone 
through a bit of wholesome bough-magandy with the wench. 
She told him sharply to skip such interludes, and he made her 
a droll little bow. But when he began to discuss the political 
situation (two Soviet generals had just been attached to the 
Extremist government as Foreign Advisers), a familiar vacant 
expression appeared in her eyes. Now r that he was safety out of 
the country, the entire blue bulk of Zembla, from Embla 
Point to Emblem Bay, could sink in the sea for all she cared. *

phone conversations in English — broken English, to be exact, 
with one tense, no articles, and two pronunciations, both 
wrong. Furthermore, by their following the crafty system (in- 
vented in the chief BIC country) of using two different sets of 
code words — headquarters, for instance, saying “bureau” tor 
“king,” and Gradus saying “letter,” they enormously increased 
the difficulty of communication, Fach side, fin?lly, had for- 
gotten the meaning of certain phrases pertaining to the other's

combined charades with an obstacle jace in the dark. Head- 
quarters thought it understood that letters from the King 
divulging his whereabouts could be obtained by breaking into 
Villa Disa and rifling the Queen’s buieau; Gradus, who had 
said nothing of the sort, but had merely tried to convey the

Shade said that more than anything on earth he loathed 
Vulgarity and Brutality, and that one found these two ideally 
united in racial prejudice. He said that, as a man of letters, 
he could not help preferring “is a Jew” to “is Jewish” and “is 
a Negro” to “js colored”, but immediately added that this way 
of alluding to two kinds of bias in one breath was a good ex- 
ample of careless, or demagogic, lumping (much exploited by 
Left Wingers 1 since it erased the distinction between two his- 
torical bells diabolical persecution and the barbarous tradi- 
tions of slavery On the other hand (he admitted) the tears of 
al ill-treated human beings, throughout the hopelessness of 
all time, mathematicallv equaled each other and perhaps (he 
thought) one did not err too much m tracing a family likeness

voung Negro gardener (see note to line 998) whom I h£ti re- 
cently hired — soon after the dismissal of an unforgettable 
roomer (see Foioword) — invariably used the word “colored.” 
As a duller m old and new words (observed Shade) he 
strongly objected to \hat epithet not only because it was 
artistically misleading, but also because its sense depended too 
much upon application and applier Many competent Negroes 
(he agreed) consideied it to be the onlv dignified word, emo- 
tionally neutral ind ethically inoffensive, their endorsement 
obliged decent non-Negroes to follow their lead, and poets do 
not like to be ted, but the genteel adore endorsements and now 
use “colored man” tor “Negio” as they do nude” for “naked” 
O'* “perspiration ’ ior “sweat”; although ol course (he con-

vinccd that it Will be even better than his homestead, with the 
big oak, and the mountain, and his pony, and the park, and 
the stable, and Grimm, the old groom, who has a way of 
fondling him whenever nobody is around. 

Something of this simple trust we too should have. With 
this divine mist of utter dependence permeating one’s being, 
no wonder one is tempted, no wonder one weighs on one's 
palm with a dreamy smile the compact firearm in its case of 
suede leather hardly bigger than a castlegate key or a boy’s 
seamed purse, no wonder one peers over the parapet into an 
inciting abyss. 

[ am choosing these images rather casually. There are purists 
who maintain that a gentleman should use a brace of pistols, 
one for each temple, or a bare botkin (note the correct spell- 
ing), and that ladies should either swallow a lethal dose or 
drown with clumsy Ophelia. Humbler humans have preferred 
sundry forms of suffocation, and minor poets have even "tried 
such fancy releases as vein tapping in the quadruped tub of a 
drafiy boardinghouse bathroom. All this is uncertain and 
messy. Of the not very many ways known of shedding one’s 
body, falling, falling, falling is the supreme method, but you 
have to select \ our sill or ledge ver v carefully so as not to hurt 
yourself or others. Jumping from a high bridge is not recom- 
mended even if you cannot swim, for wind and water abound 
in weird contingencies, and tragedt ought not to culminate in 
a record dive or a policeman’s promotion. If you rent a cell in 
the luminous waffle, room 1915, in a tall business 
center hotel browing the star dust, and pull up the window, 
and gently-* not fall, not jump — but roll out as you should for 
air comfort, there is always the change ol knocking clean 
through into your own hell a pacific roctambulator walking 
his dog; m this respect a back room might be safer, especially 
if giving on the roof of an old tenacious normal house far be- 
low where a cat may be trusted to flash out of the way. An- 
other popular take-off is a mountaintop with a sheer drop of 
say 500 meters but you must find it, because you will be sur- 
prised how easy it is to miscalculate your deflection offset, and 
have some hidden projection, some fool or a crag, rush forth 
to catch you, causing vou to bounce off it into the brush,

the real name of the respectable institute of higher philosophy 
at which our poet pokes a good deal of fanciful fun in this 
canto. Its terminal initials, HP, provide its students with the 
abbreviation Hi-Phi, and Shade neatly parodies this in his 
IPH, or If, combinations. It is situated, most picturesquely, in 
a southwestern state thal must remain anonymous here. 

I am also obliged to observe that I strongly disapprove of 
the flippancy with which our poet treats, in this canto, certain 
aspects of spiritual hope which religion alone can fulfill (see 
also note to 550). 

Line 549. While snubbing gods including the big G 

Here indeed is the Gist of the matter And this, I think, not 
only the institute (see line 517) but our poet himself missed. 
For a Christian, no Beyond is acceptable or imaginable with- 
out the participation of God in our eternal destiny, and this in 
turn implies a condign punishment for every sin, great -und 
small. My little diary happens to contain a few jottings referring 
to a conversation the poet and I had on June 23 “on my terrace 
after a game of chess, a draw.’* I transcribe them here only be- 
cause they cast a fascinating light on his attitude toward the 
subject. 

1 had mentioned — I do not recall in what connection — 
certain differences between mv Church and his. It should be 
noted that our Zemblan brand of Protestantism is rather 
closely related to the “higher” churches of the Anglican Com- 
munion, but has some magnificent peculianties ot its own. 
The Reformation with us had been headed by a composer of 
genius; our liturgy is penetrated with rich music; our boy 
choirs are the sweetest in the world. Syb‘1 Shade came from a 
Catholic family but since early girlhood developed, as she 
told me herself, “a religion of her own” — which is generally 
synonymous, at the best, with a half-heaned attachment to 
some half-heathen sect or, at the worst, with tepid atheism. 
She had weaned her husband not only from the Episcopal 
Church of his fathers, but from all forms of sacramental wor- 
ship. 

We happened to start speaking of the general present-day 
nebulation of the notion of “sin,” of its confusion with the 
much more carnally colored idea of “crime,” and I alluded 
briefly to my childhood contacts with certain rituals of our 
church. Confession with us is auricular and is conducted in a

dreadful notion of Chance reaching into eternity. Consider 
the situation. Throughout eternity our poor ghosts are ex- 
posed to nameless vicissitudes. There is no appeal, no advice, 
no support, no protection, nothing. Poor Kinbote’s ghost, poor 
Shade’s shade, may have blundered, may have taken the 
wrong turn somewhere — oh, from sheer absent-mindedness, 
or simply through ignorance of a trivial rule in the preposter- 
ous game of nature — if there be any rules. 

shade: There are rules in chess problems: interdiction of 
dual solutions, for instance. 

* inboie: I had in mind diabolical rules likely to be broken 
by the other party as soon as we come to understand them. 
That is wby goctic magic does not always work. The demons 
in their prismatic malice betray the agreement between us and 
them, and we are again in the chaos ot chance. Even if we 
temper Chance with Necessity and allow godless determinism, 
the mechanism ot cause and effect, to provide our souls after 
death with the dubious solace of metastatistics, we still have to 
reckon with the individual mishap, the thousand and second 
highway accident ot those scheduled for Independence Day in 
Hades. No-no, if we want to be serious about the hereafter let 
us not begin by degrading it to the level of a science-fiction 
yarn or a spiritualistic case history The idea of one's soul 
plunging into limitless and chaotic afterlife with no Provi- 
dence to direct her — 

shade: There is always a psychopompos around the comer, 
kn’t there? 

mnboie* Not around that corner, John. With no Provi- 
dence the soul must rely on the dust ot its husk, on the ex- 
perience gathered in the course of corporeal confinement, and 
cling childishly to small-town principles, local by-laws and a 
personality consisting mainly of the shadows ot its own prison 
bars. Such an idea is not to be entertained one instant by the 
religious mind. How much more intelligent it is — even from a 
proud infidel’s point of view! — to accept God’s Presence — a 
faint phosphorescence at first, a pale light m the dimness of 
bodily life, and a dazzling radiance after it? I too, I too, my 
dear John, have been assailed in my time 1 v religious doubts* 
The church helped me to fight them off. It also helped me not 
to ask too much, not to demand too clear an image of what is 
unimaginable. St. Augustine said —

He is not: He is not despair, He is not terror, He is not the 
earth in one’s rattling throat, not the black hum in one’s ears 
fading to nothing in nothing. I know also that the world could 
not have occurred fortuitously and that somehow Mind is in- 
volved as a main factor in the making of the universe. In try- 
ing to find the right name for that Universal Mind, or First 
Cause, or the Absolute, or Nature, I submit that the Name of 
God has priority.

completely dominated the conversation); the Head of the

whom one — Mrs. Gordon, I think) was encemte, and an- 
other, a perfect stranger, steadily talked to me, or rather into 
me, from eight to eleven owing to an unfortunate afterdinner 
distribution of available seats. My next treat, a smaller but by 
no means cozier *ouper on Saturday, May 23, was attended by 
Milton Stone (a new librarian, with whom Shade discussed 
till midnight the classification of certain Wordsmithiana); 
good old Nattochdag (whom 1 continued to see every day); 
and an undeodorized Frenchwoman (who gave me a com- 
plete picture of language-teaching conditions at the University 
of California). The date of my third and last meal at the 
Shades is not entered in my little book but I know it was one 
morning in June when I brought over a beautiful plan T had 
drawn of the King s Palace in Onhava with all sorls of heraldic 
niceties, and a touch of gold paint that I bad some trouble in 
obtaining, and was graciously urged to stay for an impromptu 
lunch. 1 should add that, despite my protests, at all three meals 
my vegetarian limitations of tare were nc t takeu into account, 
and I was exposed to animal matter m or around, some of 
the contaminated greens I might have deigned to taste. I 
revanched myself rather neatly. Of a dozen or so invitations 
that I extended, the Shades accepted jusi three. Every one of 
these meals was built around some vegetable that l subjected 
to as many exquisite metamorphoses as ParmentJer had his 
pet tuber undergo. Every time I had but one additional guest 
to entertain Mrs. Shade (who, if you please— thinning my 
voice to a feminine pitch — was allergic to artichokes, avocado 
pears, African acorns — in fact to everything beginning with an

than ten minutes, whereupon I had the task of entertaining the 
young lady with phonograph records far into the night when 
at last she rang up somebody to accompany her to a “diner**

We all know those dreams in which something Stygian 
soaks through and Lethe leaks in the dreary terms ot defective 
plumbing. Following this line, there is a false start preserved 
in the draft — and I hope the reader will feel something of the 
chill that ran down my long and supple spine when I dis- 
covered this variant: 

Should the dead murderer try to embrace 
His outraged victim whom he now must face? 

Do objects have a soul? Oi perish must 
Alike great temples and Tanagra dust? 

The last syllable of ‘Tanagra” and the first three letters of 
“dust” from the name of the murderer whose shargar (puny 
ghost) the radiant spirit of our poet was soon to face. “Simple 
chance!” the pedestrian reader may cry. But let him try to 
see, as I have tried to see, how many such combinations are 
possible and plausible. “Leningrad «jed to be Petrograd?” “A 
prig rad (obs. past tense of read) us?” 

This variant is so prodigious that only scholarly discipline 
and a scrupulous regard for the truth prevented me from in- 
serting it here, and deleting four lines elsewhere (for example, 
the weak lines 627-630) so as to preserve the length of the 
poem. 



Commentary 165 

Shade composed these lines on Tuesday, July 14th. What 
was Gradus doing that day? Nothing. Combinational fate rests 
on its laurels. We saw him last on the late afternoon of July 
10th when he returned from Lex to his hotel in Geneva, and 
there we left him. 

For the next four days Gradus remained fretting in Geneva. 
The amusing paradox with these men of action is that they 
constantly have to endure long stretches of otiosity that they 
are unable to fill with anything, lacking as they do the re- 
sources of an adventurous mind. As many people of little 
cuhure, Gradus was a voracious reader of newspapers, pam- 
phlets, chance leaflets and the multilingual literature that 
comes with nose drops and digestive tablets; but this summed 
up his concessions to intellectual curiosity, and since his eye- 
sight was not too good, and the consumability of local news 
not unlimited, he had to rely a great deal on the torpor of 
sidewalk cafes and on the makeshift of sleep. % 

How much happier the wide-awake indolents, the mon- 
archs among men, the rich monstrous brains deriving intense 
enjoyment and rapturous pangs from the balustrade of a ter- 
race at nightfall, from the lights and the lake below, from the 
distant mountain shapes melting into the dark apricot of the 
afterglow, from the black conifers outlined against the pale 
mk of the zenith, and from the garnet and green flounces of 
the water along the silent, sad, forbidden shoreline. Oh my 
sweet Boscobel* And the tender and terrible memories, and the 
shame, and the glory, and the maddening intimations, and the 
star that no party member can ever reach. 

On Wednesday morning, still without news, Gradus tele- 
graphed headquarters saying that he thoi 'jlit it unwise to wait 
an} longer and that he would he staying : t Hotel Lazuli, Nice. 

Lines 597-608: the thoughts we should roll-call, etc. 

This passage should be associated in the reader's mind with 
the extraordinary variant given in the preceding note, for only 
a week later Tanagrw dust and “our royal hands” v ere to come 
together, in real life, m real death. 

Had he not fled, our Charles II might have been executed; 
this would have certainly happened had he been apprehended

those thick fingers of fate only seldom during his flight; he 
sensed them feeling for him fas those of a grim old shepherd

night, on the damp ferny lank of Mt. Mandevil (see note to 
line 149), and next day, at a more eerie altitude, in the heady 
blue, where the mountaineer becomes aware of a phantom 
companion. Many times that night our King cast himself upon 
the ground with the desperate resolution of resting there till 
dawn that he might shift with less torment what hazard soever 
he ran. (I am thinking of yet another Charles, another long 
dark man above two yards high.) But it was all rather physical, 
or neurotic, and I know perfectly well that my King, if caught 
and condemned and led away to be shot, would have behaved 
as he does in lines 606-608: thus he would look about him

singularly tasteless device, especially since other real-lite char- 
acters, except members of the family, course, are pseu- 
donymized in the poem. 

This name, no doubt, is most tempting The star over the 
blue eminently suits an astronomer though actually neither 
his first nor second name bears any relation to the celestial 
vault: the first was given him in memory of his grandfather, 
a Russian starover (accented, incidentally, on the ultima), that 
is, Old Believer (member of a schismatic sect), named 
Sinyavin, from siniy, Russ, “blue” This ainyavin migrated 
from Saratov to Seattle and begot a son who eventually 
changed his name to Blue and married Stella Lazurchik, an 
Americanized Kashube. So it goes. Honest Starover Blue will 
probably be surprised by the epithet bestowed upon him by a

to a person who deliberately peels off a drab and unhappy 
past and replaces it with a brilliant invention. That’s merely 
turning a new leaf with the left hand.” 

I patted my friend on the head and bowed slightly to 
Ebcrthella H. The poet looked at me with glazed eyes. She 
said: 

“You must help us, Mr. Kinbote: I maintain that what’s 
hi* name, old — the old man, you know, at the Exton railway 
station, who thought he was God and began redirecting the

offered a lighted match to my friend who had his pipe in his

ncntjng, indeed, the whole passage about the activities of the

hoary enchanter of the elf-haunted alderwood, who falls in

not sufficiently admire the ingenious way in which Shade man-

See it and condemn the fashionable device of entitling a

stitutes the easy allusiveness of literacy for original fancy and

The other poem, Andrew Marvell’s “The Nymph on the 
Death ot her Fawn,” seems to be, technically, even tougher 
to stuff into French verse. If in the Donne translation, Miss 
Jrondell was perfectly justified m matching hnglish pentame-

Line 681: gloomy Russians spied 

There is really nothing metaphysical, or racial, about this 
gloom. It is merely the outward sign of congested nationalism 
and a provincial’s sense of inferiority — that dreadful blend 
so typical of Zemblans under the Extremist rule and of Rus- 
sians under the Soviet regime. Ideas in modern Russia are 
machine-cut blocks coming in solid colois; the nuance is out- 
lawed, the interval walled up, the curve grossly stepped. 

However, not all Russians are gloomy, and the two young 
experts from Moscow whom our new government engaged 
to locate the Zemblan crown jewels turned out to be posi- 
tively rollicking. The Extremists were right in believing that 
Baron Bland, the Keeper of the Treasure, had succeeded in 
hiding those jewels before he jumped or fell from the North 
Tower; but they did not know he had had a helper and were 
wrong in thinking the jewels must be looked for in the palace 
which the gentle white-haired Bland had never left except 
to die. I may add, with pardonable satisfaction, that they 



Commentary 173 

were, and still are, cached in a totally different — and quite 
unexpected — corner of Zembla. 

In an earlier note (to line 130) the reader has already 
glimpsed those two treasure hunters at work. After the King’s 
escape and the belated discovery of the secret passage, they 
continued their elaborate excavations until the palace was all 
honeycombed and partly demolished, an entire wall of one 
room collapsing one night, to yield, in a niche whose presence 
nobody had suspected, an ancient salt cellar of bronze and 
King Wigbert’s drinking horn; but you will never find our 
crown, necklace and scepter. 

All this is the rule of a supernal game, all this is the im- 
mutable fable of fate, and should not be construed as reflect- 
ing on the efficiency of the two Soviet experts — who, anyway, 
were to be marvelously successful on a later occasion with 
another job (see note to line 747). Their names (probably 
fictilious) were Andronnikov and Niagarin One has seldbm 
seen, at least among waxworks, a pair of more pleasant, 
presentable chaps. Everybody admired their clean-shaven jaws, 
elementary facial expressions, wavy hair, and perfect teeth. 
Tall handsome Andronnikov seldom smiled but the crinkly 
little ruys of his orbital flesh bespoke infinite humor while 
the min furrows descending from the sides of his shapely 
nostrils evoked glamorous associations with flying aces and 
sagebrush heroes. Niagarin, on the other hand, was of com- 
paratively short stature, had somewhat more rounded, albeit 
quite manly features, and every now and then would flash 
a big boyish smile remindful of scoutmasters with something 
to hide, or those gentlemen who cheat in television quizzes. 
It was delightful to watch the two splendid Sovietchiks run- 
ning about in the yard and kicking a chalk-dusty, thumping- 
tight soccer ball (looking so large and bald in such surround- 
ings). Andronnikov could tap-play it on his toe up and down 
a dozen times before punting it rocket straight into the mel- 
ancholy, surprised, bleached, harmless heavens; and Niagarin 
could imitate to perfection the mannerisms of a certain stu- 
pendous Dynamo goalkeeper. They used to hand out to the 
kitchen boys Russian caramels with plums or cherries de- 
picted on the rich luscious six-cornered wrappers that enclosed 
a jacket of thinner paper with the mauve mummy inside; and 
lustful country girls were known to creep up along the 
drungen (bramble-choked footpaths) to the very foot of the 



174 


PALE FIRB 


bulwark when the two silhouetted against the now flushed 
sky sang beautiful sentimental military duets at eventide on 
the rampart. Niagarin had a soulful tenor voice, and Andron- 
nikov a hearty baritone, and both wore elegant jackboots of 
soft black leather, and the sky turned away showing its ethe- 
real vertebrae. 

Niagarin who had lived in Canada spoke English and 
French; Andronnikov had some German The little Zemblan 
they knew was pronounced with that comical Russian accent 
that gives vowels a kind of didactic plenitude of sound. They 
were considered models of dash by the Extremist guards, and 
my dear Odonello once earned a harsh reprimand from the 
dommandant by not having withstood the temptation to imi- 
tate their walk, both moved with an identical little swagger, 
and both were conspicuously bandy-legged. 

When I was a child, Russia enjeved quite a vogue at the 
court of Zembla but that was a different Russia — a Russia 
that hated tyrants and Philistines, injustice and cruelty, the 
Russia of ladies and gentlemen and liberal aspirations. We 
may add that Charles the Beloved couUl boast of some Rus- 
sian blood In medieval times two of his ancestors had married 
Novgorod princesses. Queen Yaruga (reigned 1799-1800)

the unfamiliar French contraption when the Rolls-Royce bom 
Sylvia O'DonnelTs manor turned toward his green silks from 
a road and approached along the mowntrop, its fat wheels 
bouncing disapprovingly and its black shining body slowly 
gliding along. Fain would I elucidate this business of para- 
chuting but (it being a matter of mere sentimental tradition 
rather than a useful manner of transportation) this is not 
strictly necessary in these notes to Pale Fire . While Kingsley, 
the British chauffeur, an old and absolutely faithful retainer, 
was doing his best to cram the bulky and ill-folded parachute 
into the boot, I relaxed on a shooting stick he had supplied 
me with, sipping a delightful Scotch and water from the car 
bar and glancing (amid an ovation of crickets and that vortex 
of yellow and maroon butterflies that so pleased ChateaubriaqjJ 
on his arrival in America) at an article in The New York 
Times in which Sylvia had vigorously and messily marked out 
in red pencil a communication from New Wye which told 
of the “distinguished poet’s’* hospitalization. I had been look- 
ing forward to meeting my favorite American poet who, as 
I felt sure at the moment, would die long before the Spring 
Term, but the disappointment was little more than a mental 
shrug of accepted regret, and discarding the newspaper, I 
looked around me with enchantment and physical wellbeing 
despite the congestion in my nose. Beyond the field the great 
green steps of turf ascended to the multicolored coppices; 
one could see above them the white brow of the manor; 
clouds melted into the blue. Suddenly I sneezed, and sneezed 
again. Kingsley offered me another drink but I declined it, 
and democratically joined him in the front seat. My hostess 
was in bed, suffering from the aftereffects of a special injec- 
tion that she had been given in anticipation of a journey 
to a special place in Africa. In answer to my “Well, how are 
you?** she murmured that the Andes had been simply mar- 
velous, and then in a slightly less indolent tone of voice in- 
quired about a notorious actress with whom her son was said 
to be living in sin. Odon. I said, had promised me he would 
not marry her. She inquired if I had had a good hop and

a polite note congratulating him on his restored health and 
jokingly “warning” him that beginning with February he 
would have a very ardent admirer of his for neighbor. I never 
received any answer, and my civility was never recalled later 
so I suppose it got lost among the many “fan” letters that 
literary celebrities receive, although one might have expected 
Sylvia or somebody to have told the Shades of my arrival. 

The poet’s recovery turned out indeed to be very speedy 
and would have to be called miraculous had there been any- 
thing organically wrong with his heart. There was not; a 
poet’s nerves can play the queerest tricks but they also can 
quickly recapture the rhythm of health, and soon John Shade, 
in his chair at the head of an oval tabic, was again speaking 
of bis favorite Pope to eight pious young men, a crippled 
extramural woman and three coeds, one of them a tutorial 
dream. He had been told not to curtail his customary exer- 
cise, such as walks, but 1 must admit J experienced mysqjf 
palpitations and cold sweats at the sight of that precious 
old man wielding rude garden tools or squirming up the col- 
lege hall stairs as a Japanese fish up a cataract. Incidentally: 
the reader should not lake too seriously or too literally the 
passage about the aleit doctor (an alert doctor, w'ho as I well 
know once confused neuralgia with cerebral sclerosis). As I 
gathered from Shade himself, no emergency incision was per- 
formed; the heart was not compressed by hand; and if it 
stopped pumping at all, the pause must have been very brief 
and so to speak superficial. All this of couise cannct detract 
fiom the great epic beauty of the passage. (Lines 691 697) 

line 697: Conclusive destination 

Gradus landed at the Cote d’Azur airport in the early 
afternoon of July 15. Despite his worries he could not 
help being impressed by the torrent of magnificent trucks, 
agile motor bicycles and cosmopolitan private cars on the 
Promenade. He remembered and disliked the torrid heat and 
the blinding blue of the sea. Hotel Lazuli, where before World 
War Two he had spent a week with a consumptive Bosnian 
terrorist, when it was a squalid, running-water place fre- 
quented by young Germans, was now a squalid, running- 
water place frequented by old Frenchmen. It was situated 
in a transverse street, between two thoroughfares parallel to 
the quay, and the ceaseless roar of crisscross traffic mingling

with the grinding and banging of construction work proceed- 
ing under the auspices of a crane opposite the hotel (which 
had been surrounded by a stagnant calm two decades earlier) 
was a delightful surpise for Gradus, who always liked a little 
noise to keep his mind off things. ( u £a distrait " as he said 
to the apologetic hostlerwife and her sister). 

After scrupulously washing his hands, he went out again, 
a tremor of excitement running like fever down his crooked 
spine. At one of the tables of a sidewalk caf6 on the corner 
of his street and the Promenade, a man in a bottle-green 
jacket, sitting in the company of an obvious whore, clapped 
both palms to his face, emitted the sound of a muffled sneeze, 
and kept masking himself with his hands as he pretended to 
wait for the second installment. Gradus walked along the 
north side of the embankment. After stopping for a minute 
before the display of a souvenir shop, he went inside, asked 
the price of a little hippopotamus made of violet glass, and 
purchased a map of Nice and its environs. As he walked 
on to the taxi stand in rue Gambetta, he happened to notice 
two young tourists in loud shirts stained with sweat, their 
faces and necks a bright pink from the heat and imprudent 
solarization; they carried carefully folded over their arms 
the silk-lined doublebreasted coats of their wide-trousered 
dark suits and did not look at our sleuth who despite his 
being exceptionally unobservant felt the undulation of some- 
thing faintly familiar as they brushed past. They knew noth- 
ing of his presence abroad or of his interesting job; in point 
of fact, only a few minutes ago had their, and his, superior 
discovered that Gradus was in Nice and not in Geneva. 
Neither had Gradus been informed that he would be assisted 
in his quest by the Soviet sportsmen, Andronnikov and 
Niagarin, whom he had casually met once or twice on the 
Onhava Palace grounds when re-paning a broken window 
and checking for the new government the rare Rippleson 
panes in one of the ex-royal hothouses; and next moment he 
had lost the thread end of recognition as he settled down 
with the prudent wriggle of a short-legged person in the back 
seat of an old Cadillac and asked to be taken to a restaurant 
between Pellos and Cap Turc. It is hard to say what our 
man's hopes and intentions were. Did he want just to peep 
through the myrtles and oleanders at an imagined swimming 
pool? Did he expect to hear the continuation of Gordon's

bravura piece played now in another rendition, by two larger 
and stronger hands? Would he have crept, pistol in hand, to 
where a sun-bathing giant lay spread-eagled, a spread eagle 
of hair on his chest? We do not know, nor did Gradus per* 
haps know himself; anyway, he was spared an unnecessary 
journey. Modem taximen are as talkative as were the barbers 
of old, and even before the old Cadillac had rolled out of 
town, our unfortunate killer knew that his driver’s brother 
had worked in the gardens of Villa Disa but that at present 
nobody lived there, the Queen having gone to Italy for the 
rest of July. 

At his hotel the beaming proprietress handed him a tele- 
gram. It chided him in Danish for leaving Geneva and told 
him to undertake nothing until further notice. It also advised 
him to forget his work and amuse himself. But what (save 
dreams of blood) could be his amusements? He was not 
interested in sightseeing or seasiding. He had long stopp^i 
drinking. He did not go to concerts. He did not gamble. 
Sexual impulses had greatly bothered him at one time but 
that was over. After his wife, a header in Radugovitra, had 
left him (with a gypsy lover), he had lived in sin with his 
mother-in-law until she was removed, blind and dropsical, to 
an asylum for decayed widows. Since then he had tried several 
times to castrate himself, had been laid up at the Glassman 
Hospital with a severe infection, and now, at forty-four, was 
quite cured of the lust that Nature, the grand cheat, puts into 
us to inveigle us into propagation. No wonder the advice to 
amuse himself infuriated him. I think 1 shall break this note 
here. 

Lines 704-707: A system, etc. 

The fitting-in of the threefold “cells interlinked’’ is most 
skillfully managed, and one derives logical satisfaction from 
the “system” and “stem” interplay. 

Lines 727-728: No, Mr. Shade . . . just half a shade 

Another fine example of our poet’s special brand of com- 
binational magic. The subtle pun here turns on two addi- 
tional meanings of “shade” besides the obvious synonym of 
“nuance.” The doctor is made to suggest that not only did 
Shade retain in his trance half of his identity but that he 
was also half a ghost. Knowing the particular medical man

who treated my friend at the time, I venture to add that he 
is far too stodgy to have displayed any such wit. 

Lines 734*735: probably . . . wobble . . . limp blimp . . * 
unstable 

A third burst of contrapuntal pyrotechnics. The poet’s plan 
is to display in the very texture of his text the intricacies of 
the “game” in which he seeks the key to life and death (see 
lines 808-829). 

Line 74]: the outer glare 

On the morning of July 16 (while Shade was working 
on the 698-746 section of his poem) dull Gradus, dreading 
another day of enforced inactivity in sardonically sparkling, 
stimulatingly noisy Nice, decided that until hunger drove him 
out he would not budge from a leathern armchair in the 
simulacrum of a lobby among the brown smells of his dingy 
hotel Unhurriedly he went through a heap of old magazines 
on a nearby table. There he sat, a little monument of taci- 
turnity, sighing, puffing out his cheeks, licking his thumb 
before turning a page, gaping at the pictures, and moving 
his lips as he climbed down the columns of printed matter. 
Having replaced everything in a neat pile, he sank back in 
his chair closing and opening his gabled hands in various 
constructions of tedium — when a man who had occupied a 
seat next to him got up and walked into the outer glare leaving 
his paper behind. Gradus pulled it into his lap, spread it out — 
and froze over a strange piece of local news that caught his 
eye: burglars bad btoken into Villa Disa and ransacked a 
bureau, taking from a jewel box a number of valuable old 
medals. 

Here was something to brood upon. Had this vaguely un- 
pleasant incident some bearing on his quest? Should he do 
something about it? Cable headquarters? Hard to word suc- 
cinctly a simple fact without having it look like a crypto- 
gram. Airmail a clipping? He was in his room working on the 
newspaper with a safety razor blade when there was a bright 
rap-rap at the door. Gradus admitted an unexpected visitor — 
one of the greater Shadows, whom he had thought to be

He was a merry, perhaps overmerry, fellow, in a green 
velvet jacket. Nobody liked him, but he certainly had a keen 
mind. His name, Izumrudov, sounded rather Russian but 
actually meant “of the Umruds,” an Eskimo tribe sometimes 
seen paddling their umyaks (hide-lined boats) on the em- 
erald waters of our northern shores. Grinning, he said friend 
Gradus must get together his travel documents, including a 
health certificate, and take the earliest available jet to New 
York. Bowing, he congratulated him on having indicated with 
such phenomenal acumen the right place and the right way. 
Yes, after a thorough perlustration ot the loot that Andron 
and Niagarushka had obtained from the Queen’s rosewood 
writing desk (mostly bills, and treasured snapshots, and those 
silly medals) a letter from the King did turn up giving his ad- 
dress which was of all places — Our man, who interrupted t^ 
herald of success to say he had never — was bidden not to 
display so much modesty. A slip of paper was now produced 
on which Izuraiudos, shaking with laughter (death is hilari- 
ous), wrote out ior Gradus their client's alias, the name of 
the university ft here he taught, and that of the town where 
it was situated. No, the slip was not for keeps. He could 
keep it only while memorizing it. This brand of paper (used 
by macaroon makers) was not only digestible but delicious. 
The gay green vision withdrew- -to resume his whoring no 
doubt. How one hates such men! 

Lines 747-748: a story in the magazine about a Mrs. Z. 

Anybody having access to a good library could, no doubt, 
easily trace that story to its source and find the name of the 
lady; but such humdium pottoiings are beneath true scholar-

At this point my leader may be amused by my allusion to

An image of Mont Blanc’s “blue-shaded buttresses and 
sun-creamed domes” is fleetingly glimpsed through the cloud 
of that particular poem which I wish 1 could quote but do 
not have at hand. The “white mountain” of the lady’s dream, 
caused by a misprint to tally with Shade’s “white fountain,” 
makes a thematic appearance here, blurred as it were by the 
lady’s grotesque pronunciation.

Line 802. mountain 

The passage 797 (second part of line) -809, on the poet’s 
sixty-fifth card, was composed between the sunset of July 18 
and the dawn of July 19. That morning I had prayed in two 
different churches (on either side, as it were, of my Zemblan 
denomination, not represented in New Wye,} and had strolled 
home in an elevated state of mind. There was no cloud in the 
wistful sky, and the very earth seemed to be sighing after our 
Lord Jesus Christ. On such sunny, sad mornings I always feel 
in my bones that thexe is a chance yet of my not being ex- 
cluded from Heaven, and that salvation maj be granted to 
me despite the frozen mud and horror in my heart As T was 
ascending with bowed head the gravel path to my poor rented 
house, I heard with absolute distinction, as if he were stand- 
ing at my shoulder and speakmg loudlv, as to a slightly 
deaf man, Shades voice say: “Come tonight, Charlie.” T 
looked around me m awe and wonder: 1 was quite alone. 1 
af once telephoned. The Shades were out, said the cheeky 
ancillula, an obnovious little lan who came to cook for them 
on Sundays and no doubt dreamt of getting the old poet to 
cuddle her some wifeless day. I lelelcphoned two hours later; 
got, as usual, Sybil; insisted on talking to mv friend (my 
“messages” were ncvei transmitted), obtained him, and asked 
bun as calmly as possible what he had been doing around 
noon when I had heard him like a big bird in my garden. 
He could not quite remember, said wait a minute, he had 
been playing golf with Paul (whoever that was), oi at least 
watching Paul play with another colleague. I cried that I 
must see him fn the evening and all at once, with no reason 
at all, burst into tears, flooding the telephone and gasping 
for breath, a paroxysm which bad not happened to me since 
Bob left me on March 30. There was a flurry of confabula- 
tion between the Shades, and then John said: “Charles, listen. 
Let’s go for a good ramble tonight, I’ll meet you at eight.” 
It was my second good ramble since July 6 (that unsatisfac- 
tory nature talk); the third one, one July 21, was to be ex* 
cccdingly brief. 

Where was I? Yes, trudging along again as in the old days 
with John, in the woods of Arcady, under a salmon sky. 

4&lt; Well,” I said gaily, “what were you writing about last 
night, John? Your study window was simply blazing.”

‘'Mountains,” he answered. 

The Bera Range, an erection of veined stone and shaggy 
firs, rose before me in all its power and pride. The splendid 
news made my heart pound, and I telt that I could now, in 
my turn, afford to be generous. I begged my friend not to 
impart to me anything more if he did not wish it. He said 
yes, he did not, and begain bewailing the difficulties of his 
self-imposed task. He calculated that during the last twenty- 
four hours his brain had put m, roughly, a thousand minutes 
Of work, and had produced fifty lines (say, 797-847) or one 
syllable every two minutes. He had finished his Third, pe- 
nultimate, Canto, and had started on Canto Four, bis last 
(see Foreword, see Foreword, at once), and wou : d I mind 
very much it wc started to go home — though it was only 
around nine — so that he could plunge back into his chaos 
and drag out of it, with all its wet stars, his cosmos? 

How could I say no? That mountain air had gone to my 
head: he was reassembling my Zemblal 

Lines 803: a misprint 

Translators of Shade’s poem are bound to have trouble 
with the transformation, at one stroke, of 'mountain" into 
“fountain”: it cannot he rendered in French or Geirnan, or 
Russian, or Zemblan; so the translator will have to put it into 
one of those footnotes that are the togue’s galleries of words. 
However! There exists to my knowledge one absolutely ex- 
traordinary, unbelievably elegant case, where not only two, 
but three words are involved. The story itself is trivial enough 
(and probably apocryphal). A newspaper account of a Rus- 
sian tsar’s coronation had, instead of korom (crown), the 
misprint vorona (crow), and when next day this was apolo- 
getically “corrected,” it got misprimed a second time as korova 
(cow). The artistic correlation between the crown-crow-cow 
series and the Russian korona-vorona-korova series is some- 
thing that would have, i am sure, enraptured my poet. I have 
seen nothing like it on lexical playfields and the odds against 
the double coincidence defy computation. 

Line 810: a web of sense

gas station nearby, sells worms to fishermen, and usually does 
not bother me, but the other day he suggested 1 “grab any 
old book” from a shelf in his room. Not wishing to offend 
him, I cocked my head at them, to one side, and then to 
the other, but they were all dog-eared paperback mystery 
stories and did not rate more than a sigh and a smile. He 
said wait a minute — and took from a bedside recess a bat- 
tered clothbound treasure. “A great book by a great guy,” 
the letters of Franklin Lane. “Used to see a lot of him in 
Rainier Park when I was a young ranger up there. You take 
it for a couple of days. You won’t regret itP 

1 did not. Here is a passage that curiously echoes Shade’s 
tone at the end of Canto Three. It comes from a manuscript 
fragment written by Lane on May 17, 1921, on the eve of 
bis death, after a major operation: “And if I had passed into 
that otbei land, whom would J have sought? . . . Aristotle! 
— Ah, there would be a man to talk with! What satisfaction 
to «*ee him take like reins from between his fingers, the long 
ribbon of man's life and trace it through the mystifying maze 
of all the wondciful adventure. . . . The crooked made 
straight. Hie dacdalian plan simplified by a look from above 
— smeared out as it were by the splotch of some master 
thumb that made the whole involuted, boggling thing one 
beautiful straight line.” 

Line 81 9; Playing a game of woiids 

My illustrious friend showed a chddish predilection for all 
sorts of word games and especially for so-called word golf. 
He would intei rupf the flow of a prismatic conversation to 
indulge in this particular pastime, and naturally it would 
have been boorish of me to refuse playing with him. Some 
of my records are: hate-love in three, lass-male in four, and 
live-dead in five (with ‘lend” in the middle).

Fervently would 1 wish to report that the reading in the 
draft was:

— but alas, it is not so: the card with the draft has not been 
preserved by Shade.

Line 830: Sybil, it is 

This elaborate rhyme comes as an apotheosis crowning 
the entire canto and synthesizing the contrapuntal aspects of 
its “accidents and possibilities.” 

Lines 835-838. Now l shall spy, etc. 

The canto, begun on July 19tb, on card sixty-eight, opens 
with a typical Shadism: the cunning working-in of several 
inter-echoing phrases into a jumble of enjarabments. Actu- 
ally, the promise made in these four lines will not be really 
kept except for the repetition of their incantatory rhythm 
in lines 915 and 923-924 (leading to the savage attack in 
925-930). The poet like a fiery rooster seems to flap his wings 
in a preparatory burst of would-be inspiration, but the sun 
does not rise. Instead of the wild poetry promised here, we 
get a jest or two, a bit ot satire, and at the end ot the canto, 
a wonderful radiance of tenderness and repose. 

Line r 841-872. two methods of composing 

Really three if we count the all-important method of rely- 
ing on the flash and flute of the subliminal world and its 
“mute command” (line 8 7 1). 

Line 873 My best time 

As my dear friend was beginning with this line his July 
20 batch ot cards (card seventy-one to card seventy-six, end- 
ing with lme 948), Gradus, at the Orly airport, was walking 
aboard a jetliner, fastening his seat belt, reading a newspaper, 
rising, soaring, desecrating the sky. 

Lines 887-888: Since my biographer may be too staid or 
know too little 

Too staid? Know too little? Had my poor friend precognized 
who that would be, he would have been spared those con- 
jectures. As a matter of tact 1 had the pleasure and the honor 
of witnessing (one March morning) the performance he de- 
scribes in the next lines. I was going to Washington and just 
before starting remembered he had said he wanted me to look 
up something m the Library of Congress. I hear so clearly in 
my mind's ear Sybil’s cool voice saying: “But John cannot see 
you, he is in bis bath”; and John’s raucous roar coming from

the bathroom: “Let him in, Sybil, he won’t rape me!” But 
neither he nor I could recall what that something was. 

Lines 894: a king 

Pictures of the King had not infrequently appeared in 
America during the first months of the Zemblan Revolution. 
Every now and then some busybody on the campus with a 
retentive memory, or one of the clubwomen who were always 
after Shade and his eccentric friend, used to ask me with 
the inane meaningfulness adopted in such cases if anybody 
had told me how much 1 resembled that unfortunate mon- 
arch. I would counter with something on the lines of “all 
Chinese look alike” and change the subject. One day, how- 
ever, in the lounge of the Faculty Club where I lolled sur- 
rounded by a number of my colleagues, I had to put up with 
a particularly embarrassing onset. A visiting German lecturer 
from Oxford kept exclaiming, aloud and under his breatff, 
that the resemblance was “absolutely unheard of,” and when 
I negligently obseived that all bearded Zemblans resembled 
one another — and that, in fact, the name Zembla is a cor- 
ruption not of the Russian zemlya , but of Semblerland, a 
land of reflections, of “resemblers”— my tormentor said: “Ah, 
yes, but King Charles wore no beard, and yet it is his very 
face! 1 had fhe added] the honor of being seated within a 
few yards of the royal box at a Sport Festival in Onhava 
which 1 visited with my wife, who is Swedish, in 1956. We 
have a photograph of him at home, and her sister knew very 
well the mother of one of his pages, an interesting woman. 
Don’t you see [almost tugging at Shade’s lapel] the astound- 
ing similarity of features — of the upper part ot the face, and 
the eyes, yes, the eyes, and the nose bridge?” 

“Nay, sir” [said Shade, refolding a leg and ^lightly rolling 
in his armchair as wont to do when about to deliver a pro- 
nouncement] “there is no resemblance at all I have seen the 
King in newsreels, and there is no resemblance. Resemblances 
are the shadows of differences. Different people see different 
similarities and simitar differences.” 

Good Netochka, who had been looking singularly uncom- 
fortable during this exchange, remarked in his gentle voice 
how sad it was to think that such a “sympathetic ruler” had 
probably perished in prison.

including Dr. Zhivago, and so torth): “Your regrets are 
groundless’* [said he]. “That sorry ruler is known to have 
escaped disguised as a nun; but whatever happens, or has 
happened to him, cannot interest the Zemblan people. History 
has denounced him, and that is his epitaph.” 

Shade: ‘True, sir. In due time history will have denounced 
everybody. The King may be dead, or he may be as much 
alive as you and Kinbote, but let us respect facts. I have 
it from him [pointing to'me] that the widely circulated stuff 
about the nun is a vulgar pro-Extiemist fabrication. The 
Extremists and their friends invented a lot of nonsense to 
conceal their discomfiture; but the truth is that the King 
walked out of the palace, and crossed the mountains, and 
left the country, not in the black garb of a pale spinster but 
dressed as an athlete in scarlet wool.” 

“Strange, strange,” said the German visitor, who by some 
quirk of alderwood ancestry had been alone to catch the 
eerie note that had throbbed by and was gone. 

Shade [smiling and massaging my knee]: “Kings do not 
die — they only disappear, eh, Charles?” 

“Who said that?” asked sharply, as if coming out ot a 
trance, the ignorant, and always suspicious, Head of the Eng-

“The third in the witch row,” I precised quaintly, and 
everybody laughed. 

“I would rather say,” remarked Mr. Pardon — American 
History — “that she looks like Judge Goldsworth” (“One of 
us,” interposed Shade inclining his head), “especially when 
he is real mad at the whole world after a good dinner.”

Kinbote: “You are confusing me with some refugee from 
Nova Zembla” [sarcastically stressing the “Nova”]. 

“Didn’t you tell me, Charles, that kinbote means regicide 
in your language?” asked my dear Shade. 

“Yes, a king’s destroyer,” I said (longing to explain that 
a king who sinks his identity in the mirror of exile is in a 
sense just that). 

Shade [addressing the German visitor]: “Professor Kinbote 
is the author of a remarkable book on surnames. I believe 
[to me] there exists an English translation?” 

“Oxford, ”1 replied. 

“You do know Russian, though?” said Pardon. “I think I 
heard you, the other dav, talking to — what’s his name— oh, 
my goodness” [laboriously composing his lips]. 

Shade: “Sir. we all find it difficult to attack that name” 
[laughing]. 

Professor Hurley: “Think of the French word for ‘tire’: 
punoo 

Shade: “Why, sir, I am afraid you have only punctured 
the difficult)” [laughing uproariously], 

“Flatman,” quipped I. “Yes,” I went on, turning to Pardon, 
“I certainly do speak Russian. You see, it was the fashionable 
language par excellence, much more so than French, among 
the nobles of Zembla at least, and at its court. Today, of 
course, all this has changed. Jt is now the lower classes who 
are forcibly taught to speak Russian.” 

“Aren’t we, too, trying to teach Russian in our schools?” 
said Pink. 

In the meantime, at the other end of the room, young 
Emerald had been communing with the bookshelves. At this 
point he returned with the T-Z volume of an illustrated en- 
cyclopedia. 

“Well,” said he, “here he is, that king. But look, he is 
young and handsome” (“Oh, that won’t do,” wailed the Ger- 
man visitor.) “Young, handsome, and wearing a fancy uni- 
form,” continued Emerald. “Quite the fancy pansy, in fact”

“And you/’ 1 said quietly, “are a foul-minded pup in a 
cheap green jacket.” 

“But what have I said?” the young instructor inquired 
of the company, spreading out his palms like a disciple in 
Leonardo’s Last Supper . 

“Now, now,” said Shade. “I’m sure, Charles, our young 
friend never intended to insult your sovereign and name- 
sake.” 

“He could not, even if he had wished,” I observed placidly, 
turning it all into a joke. 

Gerald Emerald extended his hand— which at the moment 
of writing still remains in that position. 

Lines 895-899: The more I weigh . . or this dewlap 

Instead of these facile and revolting lines, the draft gives:

“In nature’s strife when fortitude prevails 
The victim falters and the viclor fails.”

Line 920: little hairs stand on end 

Alfred Housman, whose collection The Shropshire 

Lad vies with the In Memoriam of Alfred Tennyson 
(1809-1892) in representing, perhaps (no, delete this craven 
“perhaps”), the highest achievement of English poetry in a 
hundred years, says somewhere (in a foreword?) exactly the 
opposite: The bristling of thrilled little hairs obstructed his 
barbering; but since both Alfreds certainly used an Ordinary 
Razor, and John Shade an ancient Gillette, the discrepancy 
may have been due to the use of different instruments. 

Line 922: held up by Our Cream 

This is not quite exact. In the advertisement to which it 
refers, the whiskers are held up by a bubbly foam, not by a 
creamy substance. 

After this line, instead of lines 923-930, we find the follow- 
ing, lightly deleted, variant: 

v All artists have been born in what they call 
a sorry age; mine is the worst of all: 



Commentary 191 

An age that thinks spacebombs and spaceships take 
A genius with a foreign name to make. 

When any jackass can rig up the stuff; 

An age in which a pack of rogues can bluff 

The selenographer; a comic age 

That sees in Dr. Schweitzer a great sage. 

Having struck this out, the poet tried another theme, but 
these lines he also canceled: 

England where poets flew the highest, now 
Wants them to plod and Pegasus to plough; 

Now the prosemongers of the Grubby Croup, 

The Message Man, the owlish Nincompoop 
And all the Social Novels of our age 
Leave but a pinch of coal dust on the page. 

line 929: Freud 

Jn my mind's eye I see again the poet literally collapsing 
on his lawn, beating the grass with his list, and shaking and 
howling with laughter, and myself, Dr Kinbote, a torrent 
of tears streaming down my beard, as I try to read coherently 
certain tidbits from a book I had filched from a classroom: 
a learned work on psychoanalysis, used in American colleges, 
repeat, used in American coDeges. Alas, 1 find only two items 
preserved in my notebook: 

By pieking the nose in spite of all commands to the con- 
trary, or when a youth is ail the time sticking bis finger 
through his buttonhole ... the analytic teacher knows 
that the appetite of the lustful one knows no limit in his 
phantasies.

Psychoanalytical Method . 1917, N.Y., p. 79) 

The little cap of red velvet in the German version of 
Little Red Riding Hood is a symbol of menstruation.

Line 934: big trucks 

I must say I do not remember hearing very often “big 
trucks” passing in our vicinity. Loud cars, yes— -but not 
trucks. 


Line 937: Old Zembla 

I am a weary and sad commentator today. 

Parallel to the left-hand side of this card (his seventy-sixth) 
the poet has written, on the eve of his death, a line (from 
Pope’s Second Epistle of the Essay on Man ) that he may 
have intended to cite in a footnote: 

At Greenland , Zembla , or the Lord knows where 

So this is all treacherous old Shade could say about Zembla 
— my Zembla? While shaving his stubble off? Strange, 
strange . . , 

Lines 939-940: Man’s life, etc 

Jf I correctly understand the sense oi this succinct obser- 
vation, our poet suggests heie that human htc is but a senes 
of footnotes to a Vast obscure unfinished masterpiece 

Line 949: And all the time 

Thus, some tune m the morning of lulv 21, the last day of 
his life, John Shade began his last batch of cards (seventy - 
seven to eighty). Two silent time zones had now merged to 
form the standard time of one man’s fate; and it is not im- 
possible that the poet in New Wye and the thug m New York 
awoke that morning at the same crushed beat of their Time- 
keeper’s stopwatch. 

Line 949: and all the time 

And all the time he was coming nearer 

A formidable thunderstorm had greeted Gradus in New 
York on the night of his arrival from Paris (Monday, July 
20). The tropical rainfall flooded basements and subway 
tracks. Kaleidoscopic reflections played in the riverlike streets. 
Vtnogradus had never seen such a display of lightning, neither 
had Jacques d’Argus — or Jack Grey, for that matter (let us 
not forget Jack Grey!). He put up in a third-class Broadway

hotel and slept soundly, lying belly up on the bedclothes, in 
striped pajamas — the kind that Zemblans call rusker sirsusker 
(“Russian seersucker suit”) — and retaining as usual his socks: 
not since July 11, when he had visited a Finnish bathhouse in 
Switzerland, had he seen his bare feet. 

It was now July 21. At eight in the morning New York 
roused Gradus with a bang and a roar. As usual he started 
his blurry daily existence by blowing his nose. Then he took 
out of its nightbox of cardboard and inserted into his Comus- 
mask mouth an exceptionally large and fierce-looking set of 
teeth: the only bad flaw really in his otherwise harmless ap- 
pearance, This done, he fished out of his briefcase two petit- 
beurres he had saved and an even older but still quite palatable 
small, sottish, near-ham sandwich, vaguely associated with the 
train journey from Nice to Paris last Saturday night: not so 
much thriltiness on his part (the Shadows had advanced him 
a handsome sum, anyway), but an animal attachment to the 
habits of his frugal youth. After breakfasting in bed on these 
delicacies, he began preparations tor the most important day in 
his life. He had shaved yesterday — that was out of the way. 
His trusty pajamas he stuffed not into his traveling bag but 
into the briefcase, dressed, unclipped from the inside of his 
coat a cameo-pink, interdeiitally clogged pocket comb, drew 
n through his bristly hair, carefully donned his trilby, washed 
both hands with the nice, modern liquid soap in the nice, 
modem, almost odorless lavatory across the corridor, mictu- 
lared, rinsed one hand, and feeling clean and neat, went out 
for a stroll 

He had never visited Ntw York before; hut as many near- 
cretins, he was above novellv. On the previous night he had 
counted the mounting rows ot lighted windows in several sky- 
scrapcrs, and now, after checking the height of a tew more 
buildings, he felt that he knew all there was to know. He had a 
brimming cup and halt a saucerful of coffee at a crowded and 
wet counter and spent the rest ot the smoke-blue morning 
moving from bench to bench and from paper to paper in the 
westside alleys of Central Park. 

He began with the day’s copy of The New York Times . His 
lips moving like wrestling worms, he read about all kinds of 
things. Hrushchov (whom they spelled “Khrushchev”) had 
abruptly put off a visit to Scandinavia and was to visit Zetnbla 
instead (here I tune in: ' Vi nazivaete sebya zemblerarm f you

call yourselves Zemblans, a ya vas nazivayu zemlyakami, and 
I call you fellow countrymen!” Laughter and applause). The 
United States was about to launch its first atom-driven mer- 
chant ship (just to annoy the Ruskers, of course. J.G.). Last 
night, in Newark, an apartment house at 5 55 South Street wa9 
hit by a thunderbolt that smashed a TV set and injured two 
people watching an actress lost in a violent studio storm (those 
tormented spirits are terrible! C.X.K. teste J.S.). The Rachel 
Jewelry Company in Brooklyn advertised in agate type for a 
jewelry polisher who “must have experience on costume 
jewelry” (oh, Degr6 had!). The Helman brothers said they 
had assisted in the negotiations for the placement of a sizable 
note: $11,000,000, Decker Glass Manufacturing Company, 
Inc., note due July 1,” and Gradus, grown young again, 
reread this twice, with the background gray thought, perhaps, 
that he would be sixty-four four days after that (no comment) , 
On another bench he found a Monday issue of the same news- 
paper. During a visit to a museum in Whitehorse (Gradus 
kicked at a pigeon that came too near), the Queen of England 
walked to a corner of the White Animals Room, removed her 
right glove and, with her back turned to several evidently 
observant people, rubbed her forehead and one of her eyes. A 
pro-Red revolt had erupted in Iraq. Asked about the Soviet 
exhibition at the New York Coliseum, Carl Sandburg, a poet, 
replied, and I quote: “They make their appeal on the highest 
of intellectual levels.” A hack reviewer of new books for 
tourists, reviewing his own tour through Norway, said that 
the fjords were too famous to need (his) description, and that 
all Scandinavians loved flowers. And at a picnic for interna- 
tional children a Zcmblan moppet cried to her Japanese 
friend: Ufgut, ufgut, velkam ut Semblerland f (Adieu, adieu, 
till we meet in Zembla!) I confess it has been a wonderful 
game — this looking up in the WUL of various ephemerides 
over the shadow of a padded shoulder. 

Jacques d* Argus looked for a twentieth time at his watch. 
He strolled like a pigeon with his hands behind him. He had 
his mahogany shoes shined — and appreciated the way the dirty 
but pretty boy clacked taut his rag. In a restaurant on Broad- 
way he consumed a large portion of pinkish pork with sauer- 
kraut, a double helping of elastic French fries, and the half of 
an overripe melon. From my rented cloudlet l contemplate

mit a monstrous act — and coarsely enjoying a coarse meal! We 
must assume, l think, that the forward projection of what 
imagination he had, stopped at the act, on the brink of all its 
possible consequences; ghost consequences, comparable to the 
ghost toes of an amputee or to the fanning out of additional 
squares which a chess knight (that skip-space piece), standing 
on a marginal file, “feels” in phantom extensions beyond the 
board, but which have no effect whatever on his real moves, on 
the real play. 

He strolled back and paid the equivalent of three thousand 
Zemblan crowns lor his short but nice stay at Bcverland Ho- 
tel. With the illusion of practical foiesight he transferred his 
fiber suitcase and — after a moment of hesitation — his raincoat 
to the anonymous security of a station locker — where, I sup- 
pose, they are still lying as snug as my gemmed scepter, ruby 
necklace, and diamond-studded crown in — no matter, where. 
On his fateful journey he took only the battered black brief- 
case wc know: it contained a clean nylon shirt, a dirty pajama, 
a safety razor, a third petit-beurre, an empty cardboard box, a 
thick illustrated paper he had not quite finished with in the 
paik, a glass eye he once made foi his old mistress, and a 
dozen syndicalist brochures, each in several copies, printed 
with his own hands many years ago. 

He had to check m at the airport at 2 pm The night be- 
fore, when making his reservation, he had not been able to get 
a seat on the earlier flight to New Wye because of some con- 
vention there. He had fiddled with railway schedules, but these 
had evidently been arranged by a piactical jcker since the only 
available direct train (.dubbed the Square Wheel by our jolted 
and jerked students) left at 5:13 a.m., dawdled at flag sta- 
tions, and took eleven hours to cover the four hundred miles 
to Exton; you could try to cheat it by going via Washington 
but then you had to wait there at least three hours for a sleepy 
local. Buses were out so far as Gradus was concerned since he 
always got roadsick in them unless he drugged himself with 
Fahrmamine pills, and that might affect his aim. Conte to think 
of it, he was not feeling too steady anyway. 

Gradus is now much nearer to us in space and time than 
he was in the preceding cantos. He has short upright black 
hair. We can fill in the bleak oblong of his face with most of 
its elements such as thick eyebrows and a wart on the chin. He 
has a ruddy but unhealthy complexion. We see, fairly in focus, 



196 


PALE FIRE 


the structure of his somewhat mesmeric organs of vision. We 
see his melancholy nose with its crooked ridge and grooved 
tip. We see the mineral blue of his jaw and the gravelly 
pointill6 of his suppressed mustache. 

We know already some of his gestures, we know the chim- 
panzee slouch of his broad body and short hindlegs. We have 
heard enough about his creased suit. We can at last describe 
his tie, an Easter gift from a dressy butcher, his brother-in- 
law in Onhava: imitation silk, color chocolate brown, barred 
with red, the end tucked into the shirt between the second and 
third buttons, a Zemblan fashion of the nineteen thirties — and 
a father-waistcoat substitute according to the learned. Repul- 
sive black hairs coat the back of his honest rude hands, the 
scrupulously clean bands of an ultra-unionized artisan, with a 
perceptible deformation of both thumbs, typical of bobeche- 
makers. We see, rather suddenly, his humid flesh. We can even 
make out (as, head-on but quite safely, phantom-like, we pass 
through him, through the shimmering propeller oi his flying 
machine, through the delegates waving and grinning at us) 
his magenta and mulberry insides, and the strange, not so good 
sea swell undulating in his entrails. 

We can now go further and describe, to a doctor or to any- 
body else willing to listen to us, the condition of this primate’s 
soul. He could read, write and reckon, he was endowed with 
a modicum of self-awareness (with which he did not know 
what to do) , some duration consciousness, and a good memory 
for faces, names, dates and the like. Spiritually he did not 
exist. Morally he was a dummy pursuing another dummy. The 
fact that his weapon was a real one, and his quarry a highly 
developed human being, this fact belonged to our woild of 
events; in his, it had no meaning. I grant you that the idea of 
destroying “the king” did hold for him some degree ot pleas- 
ure, and therefore we should add to the list of his personal 
parts the capacity of forming notions, mainly general notions, 
as I have mentioned in another note which I will not bother to 
look up. There might be (I am allowing a lot) a slight, very 
slight, sensual satisfaction, not more I would say than what a 
petty hedonist enjoys at the moment when, retaining his 
breath, before a magnifying mirror, his thumbnails pressing 
with deadly accuracy on both sides of a full stop, he expulses 
totally the eely, semitransparent plug of a comedo— and ex- 
hales an Ah of relief. Gradus would hot have killed anybody 



Commentary 197 

had he not derived pleasure not only from the imagined act 
(insofar as he was capable of imagining a palpable future) 
but also from having been given an important, responsible 
assignment (which happened to require he should kill) by a 
group of people sharing his notion of justice, but he would 
not have taken the job if in killing he had not found some- 
thing like that rather disgusting anticomedoist’s little thrill. 

I have coasidered in my earlier note (I now see it is the note 
to line 171) the particular dislikes, and hence the motives, of 
our “automatic man,” as I phrased it at a time when he did 
not have as much body, did not offend the senses as violently 
as now; was, in a word, further removed from our sunny, 
green, grass-fragrant Arcady. Bui Our Lord has fashioned 
man so marvelously that no amount of motive hunting and 
rational inquiry can ever really explain how and why any- 
body is capable of destroying a fellow creature (this argument 
necessitates, I know, a temporary granting to Gradus of the 
status of man), unless he is defending the life ot his son, or 
his own, or the achievement of a lifetime; so that in final 
judgment of the Gradus versus the Crown case I would submit 
tfrn if his human incompleteness be deemed insufficient to ex- 
plain his idiotic journey across the Atlantic just to empty the 
magazine of his gun, we may concede, doctor, that our half- 
man was also half mad. 

Aboard the small and uncomfortable plane flying into the 
sun he found himself wedged among several belated delegates 
to the New Wye Linguistic Conference, all of them lapel- 
labeled, and lepresentmg the same foreign language, but none 
being able to speak it, so that conversation was conducted 
(across our hunched-up killer and on all sides of his im- 
mobile face) in rather ordinary Anglo-American. During this 
ordeal, poor Gradus kept wondering what caused another dis- 
comfort which kept troubling him on and off throughout the 
flight, and which was worse than the babble of the monolin- 
guists. He could not settle what to attribute it to — pork, cab- 
bage, fried potatoes or melon — for upon retasting them one 
by one in spasmodic retrospect be found little to choose be- 
tween their different but equally sickening flavors. My own 
opinion, which I would like the doctor to confirm, is that the 
French sandwich was engaged in an intestinal internecine war 
with the “French” fries. 

Upon arriving after five at the New Wyc airport he drank

two papercupfuls of nice cold milk from a dispenser and ac- 
quired a map at the desk. With broad blunt finger tapping the 
configuration of the campus that resembled a writhing stom- 
ach, he asked the clerk what hotel was nearest to the univer- 
sity, A car, he was told, would take him to the Campus Hotel 
which was a few minutes 9 walk from the Main Hall (now 
Shade Hall). During the ride he suddenly became aware of 
such urgent qualms that he was forced to visit the washroom 
as soon as he got to the solidly booked hotel. There his misery 
resolved itself in a scalding torrent of indigestion. Hardly had 
he refastened his trousers and checked the bulge of his hip 
pocket than a renewal of stabs and queaks caused him to strip 
his thighs again which be did with such awkward precipitation 
that his small Browning was all but sent flying into the depths 
of the toilet. 

He was still groaning and grinding his dentures when he and 
his briefcase re-offended the sun. It shone with all sorts ot 
speckled effects through the trees, and College Town was gay 
with summer students and visiting linguists, among whom 
Gradus might have easily passed tor a salesman hawking 
Basic-English primers for American schoolchildren or those 
wonderful new translating machines that can do it so much 
faster than a man or an animal. 

A grave disappointment awaited him at Main Hail: it had 
closed for the day. Three students lying on the grass suggested 
he try the Library, and all three pointed to it across the lawn. 
Thither trudged our thug. 

“I don’t know where he lives,” said the girt at the desk. “But 
I know he is here right now. You’ll find him, I’m sure, in North 
West Three where we have the Icelandic Collection. You go 
south [waving her pencil] and turn west, and then west again 
where you see a sort of, a sort of [pencil making a ciitular 
wiggle — round table? round bookshelf?] — No, wait a minute, 
you better just keep going west till you hit the Florence Hough- 
ton Room, and there you cross over to the north side of the 
building. You cannot miss it” [returning pencil to ear]. 

Not being a mariner or a fugitive king, he promptly got lost 
and after vainly progressing through a labyrinth of stacks, 
asked about the Icelandic Collection of a stern-looking mother 
librarian who was checking cards in a steel cabinet on a land- 
ing, Her slow and detailed directions promptly led him back to 
the main desk.

“Please, I cannot find,” he said, slowly shaking his head. 

“Didn’t you — ” the girl began, and suddenly pointed up: 
“Oh, there he is!” 

Along the open gallery that ran above the hall, parallel to 
its short side, a tall bearded man was crossing over at a mili- 
tary quick march from east to west. He vanished behind a 
bookcase but not before Gradus had recognized the great 
rugged frame, the erect carriage, the high-bridged nose, the 
straight brow, and the energetic arm swing, of Charles Xavier 
the Beloved. 

Our pursuer made for the nearest stairs — and soon found 
himself among the bewitched hush of Rare Books. The room 
was beautiful and had no doors; in fact, some moments passed 
before he could discover the draped entrance he himself had 
just used. The awful perplexities of his quest blending with the 
renewal of impossible pangs in his belly, he dashed back — ran 
three steps down and nine steps up, and burst into a circular 
room where a baldheaded suntanned professor in a Hawaiian 
shirt sat at a round table reading with an ironic expression on 
his face a Russian book. He paid no attention to Gradus who 
traversed the room, stepped over a fat little white dog without 
awakening it, clattered down a helical staircase and found him- 
self in Vault P. Here, a well-lit, pipe-lined, white-washed pas- 
sage led him to the sudden paradise of a water closet for 
plumbers or lost scholars where, cursing, he hurriedly trans- 
ferred his automatic from its precarious dangle-pouch to hi9 
coat and relieved himself of another portion of the liquid hell 
inside him. He started to climb up again, and noticed in the 
temple light of the stacks an employee, a slim Hindu boy, with 
a cal] card in his hand. I had never spoken to that lad but had 
felt more than once his blue-brown gaze upon me, and no 
doubt my academic pseudonym was familiar to him but some 
sensitive cell in him, some chord of intuition, reacted to the 
harshness of the killer’s interrogation and, as if protecting me 
from a cloudy danger, he smiled and said: 'T do not know 
him, sir.” 

Gradus returned to the Main Desk. 

“Too bad,” said the girl, “I just saw him leatfe.” 

14 Bozhe moy , Bozhe moy,” muttered Gradus, who some* 
times at moments of stress used Russian ejaculations. 

“You’ll find him in the directory,” she said pushing it to- 
wards him, and dismissing the sick man’s existence to attend

to the wants of Mr. Gerald Emerald who was taking out a fat 
bestseller in a cellophane jacket. 

Moaning and shifting from one foot to the other, Gradus 
started leafing through the college directory but when he found 
the address, he was faced with the problem of getting there. 

“Dulwich Road,” be cried to the girl. “Near? Far? Very far, 
probably?” 

“Are you by any chance Prolessor Pnin’s new assistant?” 
asked Emerald. 

“No,” said the girl. “This man is looking for Dr. Kinbote, I 
think. You aie looking for Dr. Kinbote, aren’t you?” 

“Yes, and I can’t any more,” said Gradus. 

“I thought so,” said the girl. “Doesn’t he live somewhere 
near Mr. Shade, Gerry?” 

“Oh, definitely,” said Gerry, and turned to the killer: “I 
can drive you there if you like. It is on my way.” 

Did they 'talk in the car, these two characters, the man in 
green and the man in brown? Who can say 7 They did not. 
After all, the drive took only a few minutes (it took me, at the 
wheel of my powerful Kramler, tour and a half). 

“I think I’ll drop you here,” said Mr. Fmerald “It’s that 
house up there.” 

One finds it hard to decide what Gradus alias Grey wanted 
more at that minute: discharge his gun or iid himself of the 
inexhaustible lava in his bowels As he began hurriedly 
fumbling at the car door, unfastidious Emerald leaned, close to 
him, across him, almost merging with him, to help him open 
it — and then, slamming it shut again, whiz/ed on to some tryst 
in the valley. My reader will, 1 hope, appreciate all the minute 
particulars I have taken such trouble to present to him after 
a long talk I had with the killer; he will appreciate them even 
more if 1 tell him that, according to the legend spread later by 
the police. Jack Grey had been given a lift, all the way from 
Roanoke, or somewhere, by a lonesome trucker! One can only 
hope that an impartial search will turn up the triby forgotten 
in the Library — or in Mr. Emerald’s car. 

Line 957: Night Rote 

I remember one little poem from Night Rote (meaning 
“the nocturnal sound of the sea”) that happened to be my first 
contact with the American poet Shade. A young lecturer on 
American Literature, a brilliant and charming boy from Bos- 



Commentary 201 

ton, showed me that slim and lovely volume in Onhava, in 
my student days. The following lines opening this poem, which 
is entitled “Art,** pleased me by their catchy lilt and jarred 
upon the religious sentiments instilled in me by our very 
“high** Zemblan church. 

From mammoth hunts and Odysseys 
And Oriental charms 
To the Italian goddesses 
With Flemish babes in arms. 

Lint 962: Help me, Will. Pale Fire. 

Paraphrased, this evidently means: Let me look in Shake- 
speare for something I might use for a title. And the find is 
“pale fire.” But in which of the Bard's works did our poet cull 
it? My readers must make their own research. All I have with 
me is a tiny vest pocket edition of Timon of Athens — in Zem- 
blan! It certainly contains nothing that could be regarded as 
an equivalent of “pale fire" (if it had, my luck would have 
been a statistical monster). 

English was not taught m Zembla before Mr. Campbell’s 
time. Conmal mastered it all by himself (mainly by learning a 
lexicon by heart ) as a young man, around 1880, when not the 
verbal mferno but a quiet military career seemed to open be- 
fore him, and his first work (the translation of Shakespeare’s 
Sonnets ) was the outcome of a bet with a fellow officer. He 
exchanged his frogged uniform for a scholar’s dressing gown 
and tackled The Tempest. A slow worker, he needed half a 
century lo translate the works of him whom he called “dze 
Bart,” in their entirety. After this, he went on to 
Milton and other poets, steadily drilling through the ages, and 
had just completed Kipling’s “The Rhyme of the Three 
Sealers’* (“Now this is the Law of the Muscovite that he 
proves with shot and steel”) when he fell ill and soon expired 
under his splendid painted bed ceil with its reproductions of 
Altamira animals, his last words in bis last delirium being 
“ Comment dit-on * mourir en anglais ?” — a beautiful and 
touching end. 

It is easy to sneer at Conmal’s faults. They are the naive 
failings of a great pioneer. He lived too much in his library, 
too little among boys and youths. Writers should see the world, 
pluck its figs and peaches, and not keep constantly meditating

in a tower of yellow ivory — which was also John Shade’s 
mistake, in a way. 

We should not forget that when Conmal began his stupen- 
dous task no English author was available in Zcmblan except 
Jane de Faun, a lady novelist in ten volumes whose works, 
strangely enough, are unknown in England, and some frag- 
ments of Byron translated from French versions. 

A large, sluggish man with no passions save poetry, he 
seldom moved from his warm castle and its fifty thousand 
crested books, and had been known to spend two years in bed 
reading and writing after which, much refreshed, he went for 
the first and only time to London, but the weather was foggy, 
and he could not understand the language, and so went back to 
bed for another year. 

English being Cornual's prerogative, his Shakspere remained 
invulnerable throughout the greater part of his long life. The 
venerable Duke was famed for the nobility of his work; few 
dared question its fidelity. Personally, I had never the heart to 
check it. One callous Academician who did, lost his seat in 
result and was severely reprimanded by Conmal m an ex- 
traordinary sonnet composed directly in colorful, jf not quite 
correct, English, beginning: 

I am not slave! Let be my critic slave. 

I cannot be. And Shakespeare would not want thus. 

Let drawing students copy the acanthus,

Line 991: horseshoes 

Neither Shade nor 1 had ever been able to ascertain whence 
precisely those ringing sounds came — which of the five fam- 
ilies dwelling across the road on the lower slopes of our 
woody hill played horseshoe quoits every other evening; but 
the tantalizing tingles and jingles contributed a pleasant 
melancholy note to the rest of Dulwich Hill's evening sonori- 
ties — children calling to each other, children being called 
home, and the ecstatic barking of the boxer dog whom most 
of the neighbors disliked (he overturned garbage cans) greet- 
ing his master home. 

It was this medley of metallic melodies which surrounded 
me on that fateful, much too luminous evening of July 21 
when upon roaring home from the library in my powerful car 



Commentary 203 

I at once went to see what my dear neighbor was doing. I had 
just met Sybil speeding townward and therefore nursed some 
hopes for the evening. I grant you 1 very much resembled a 
lean wary lover taking advantage of a young husband’s being 
alone in the house! 

Through the trees 1 distinguished John’s white shirt and 
gray hair: he sat in his Nest (as he called it), the arborlike 
porch or veranda I have mentioned in my note to lines 47-48. 
I could not keep from advancing a little nearer — oh, discreetly, 
almost on tiptoe; but then I noticed he was resting rather than 
writing, and I openly walked up to his porch or perch. His 
elbow was on the table, his fist supported his temple, his 
wrinkles were all awiy, his eyes moist and misty; he looked 
like an old tipsy witch. He lifted his free hand in greeting with- 
out changing his attitude, which although not unfamiliar to 
me struck me this time as more forlorn than pensive. 

“Well,” I said, “has the muse been kind to you?” 

“Very kind,” he replied, slightly bowing his hand-propped 
head: “Fxceptionally kind and gentle. In fact, I have here 
[indicating a huge pregnant envelope near him on the oilcloth] 
practically the entire pioduct. A few trifles to settle and [sud- 
denly striking the table with his fistj I’ve swung it, by God.” 

The envelope, unfastened at one end, bulged with stacked 
card?. 

“Where is the missus?” 1 asked (mouth dry). 

“Help me, Charlie, to get out of here,” he pleaded. “Foot 
gone to sleep. Sybil is at a dinner meeting of her club.” 

“A suggestion,” I said, quivering. “I have at my place half a 
gallon of Tokay. I’m ready to share my favorite wine with my 
favorite poet. We shall have for dinner a knackle ol walnuts, a 
couple of large tomatoes, and a bunch of bananas. And if you 
agree to show me your ‘finished product,’ there will be another 
treat: I promise to divulge to you why 1 gave you, or rather 
who gave you, your theme.” 

“What theme?” said Shade absently, as he leaned on my 
arm and gradually recovered the use of his numb limb. 

“Our blue incnubilable Zembla, and the red-capped Stein- 
mann, and the motorboat in the sea cave, and — ” 

“Ah,” said Shade, “1 think I guessed ydtir secret quite some 
time ago. But all the same I shall sample your wine with 
pleasure. Okay, I can manage by myself now.”

or that, especially since he was severely rationed at home. With 
an inward leap of exultation I relieved him of the large en- 
velope that hampered his movements as he descended the steps 
of the porch, sideways, like a hesitating infant. We crossed the 
lawn, we crossed the road. Clink-clank, came the horseshoe 
music from Mystery Lodge. In the large envelope I carried 1 
could feel the hard cornered, rubberbanded batches of index 
cards. We are absurdly accustomed to the miracle of a few 
written signs being able to contain immortal imagery, involu- 
tions of thought, new worlds with live people, speaking, weep- 
ing, laughing. We take it for granted so simply that in a sense, 
by the very act of brutish routine acceptance, we undo the 
work of the ages, the history of the gradual elaboration of 
poetical description and const nicti on, from the treeman to 
Browning, from the caveman to Keats. What it we awake one 
dav, all of us, and find ourselves utterly unable to read? I wish

o f the path. One’s e&gt;es could not follow the rapid butterfly in 
the sunbeams as it flashed and vanished, and flashed again, 
with an almost frightening imitation of conscious play which 
now culminated in its settling upon my delighted friend’s 
sleeve. It took off, and we saw it next moment, sporting in an 
ecstasy of frivolous haste around a laurel shrub, every now 
and then perching on a lacquered leaf and sliding down its 
grooved middle like a bov down the banisters on his birthday. 
Then the tide of the shade reached the laurels, and the mag- 
nificent, velvet-and-flame creature dissolved in it.

( Cedrus ), all insular; a Venetian sycamore tree (Jeer); two

Denmark; a midsummer elm, its barky fingers enraged with

We had reached the Golds worth side of the lane, and the 



Commentary 207 

flagged walk that scrambled along a side lawn to connect with 
the gravel path leading up from Dulwich road to the Golds- 
worth front door, when Shade remarked: “You have a caller.” 

In profile to us in the porch a short thickset, dark-haired 
man in a brown suit stood holding by its ridiculous strap a 
shabby and shapeless briefcase, his curved forefinger still 
directed toward die bell button he had just pressed. 

“I will kill him,” I muttered. Recently a bonneted girl had 
made me accept a bunch of religious tracts and had told me 
that her brother, whom for some reason I had pictured to my- 
self as a fragile neurotic youth, would drop in to discuss with 
me God’s Purpose, and explain anything I had not under- 
stood in the tracts. Youth, indeed! 

“Oh, I will kill him,” 1 repeated under my breath — so in- 
tolerable was it to think th it xhe rapture of the poem might be 
delayed. In my fury and hurry to dismiss the intruder, I out- 
stripped John who until then had been in front of me, heading 
at a good shamble for the double treat of revel and revelatidh. 

Hod Jf e\en seen Gradus before/ Let me think. Had I? 
Memory shakes her head. Nevertheless the killer affirmed to 
me later that once from my tower, overlooking the Palace 
orchard, I had waved to him as be and one of my former 
pages, a boy with hair like excelsior, were carrying cradled 
glass from the hothouse to a horse-drawn van; but, as the 
caller now veeied toward us and transfixed us with his snake- 
sad, close-set eyes, I felt such a tremor of recognition that had 
l been in bed dreaming I would have awoken with a groan. 

His fiist bullet ripped a sleeve button off my black blazer, 
another sang past my ear. it is evil piffle to assert that he aimed 
not at me (whom he had just seen in the library — let us be 
consistent, gentlemen, ours is a rational world after all), but 
at the gray-locked gentleman behind me. Oh, he was aiming 
at me all right but missing me every time, the incorrigible 
bungler, as I instinctively backed, bellowing and spreading my 
great strong arms (with my left hand still holding the poem, 
“still clutching the inviolable shade,” to quote Matthew Ar- 
nold, 1822-1888), in an effort to halt the advancing madman 
and shield John, whom I feared he might, quite accidentally, 
hit, while he, my sweet awkward old Joint, kept clawing at 
me and pulling me after him, back to the protection of his 
laurels, with the solemn fussiness of a poor lame boy trying to

them by schoolchildren, once a familiar sight in all countries 
I felt — I still feel — Tohn’s hand fumbling at mine, seeking my 
fingertips, finding them, onlv to abandon them at once as if 
passing to me, in a sublime relay race, the baton of life. 

One of the bullets that spared me struck him in the side and 
went through his heart. His presence behind me abruptly 
failing me caused me to lose my balance, and, simultaneously, 
to complete the farce of fat' my gai dener’s spade dealt gun-

and then there was the awful moment when Dr. Sutton’s 
daughter drove up with Sybil Shade. 

In the course of that chaotic night I found a moment to 
transfer the poem from under the booties of Golds worth’s four 
nymphels to the austere security of my black valise, but only 
at daybreak did I find it safe enough to examine my treasure. 

We know how firmly, how stupidly 1 believed that Shade 
was composing a poem, a kind of romaunt, about the King 
of Zembia. We have been prepared for the horrible disap- 
pointment in store for me. Oh, I did not expect him to devote 
himself completely to that theme! Il might have been blended 
of course with suine of his own life stuff and sundry Ameri- 
cana — but I was sure his poem would contain the wonderful 
incidents I had described to him, the characters I had made 
alive for him and all the unique atmosphere of my kingdom. I 
even suggested to him a good title — the title of the book in me 
whose pages he was to cut: Solus Rex; instead of which I saw 
Vale Firt&gt; which meant to me nothing I started to read the 
poem, I read faster and faster. 1 sped thiough it, snariing, as a 
furious young heir through an old deceiver’s testament. Where 
were The battlements of my sunset castle? Where was Zembia 
the Fair? Where her spine of mountain*? Where her long 
thrill through the mist? And my lovely flower hoys, and the 
spectrum or the stained windows, and the Black Rose Paladins, 
and the whole marvelous tale? Nothing of il was there! The 
complex contribution i had been pressing upon him with a 
hypnotist's patience and a lover’s urge was simply cot there. Oh, 
but i cannot express the agony! Instead of the wild glorious 
romance — what did 1 have? An autobiogiaphical, eminently 
Appalachian, rather old-fashioned nan alive in a neo-Popian 
prosodic style — beautifully written of course — Shade could 
noi write otherwise than bcauntully— but void of my magic, 
of that special rich streak of magical madness which I was 
sure would run through it and make it transcend its time. 

Gradually l regained my usual composuie. 1 reread Pale 
Fire more carefully. I liked it better when expecting less. Aud 
what was that? What was that dim distant music, those vestiges 
of color in the air? Here and there I discovered in it and espe- 
cially, especially in the invaluable variants, echoes and spangles 
of iny mind, a long ripplewake ot my glory. I now felt a new, 
pitiful tenderness toward the poem as one has for a fickle

young creature who has been stolen and brutally enjoyed by a 
black giant but now again is safe in our hall and park, 
whistling with the stableboys, swimming with the tame seal. 
The spot still hurts, it must hurt, but with strange gratitude we 
kiss those heavy wet eyelids and caress that polluted flesh. 

My commentary to this poem, now in the hands of my 
readers, represents an attempt to sort out those echoes and 
wavelets of fire, and pale phosphorescent hints, and all the 
many subliminal debts to me. Some of my notes may sound 
bitter — but I have done my best not to air any grievances. And 
in this final scholium my intention is not to complain of the 
vulgar and cruel nonsense that professional reporters and 
Shade’s “friends” in the obituaries they concocted allowed 
themselves to spout when misdescribing the circumstances of 
Shade’s death. I regard their references to me as a mixture ot 
journalistic callousness and the venom of vipers. I do not 
doubt that many of the statements made m this work wiU be 
brushed aside hy the guilty parties when it is out. Mrs Shade 
will not remember having been shown by her husband who 
“showed her everything” one or two of the precious variants. 
The three students lying on the grass will turn out to be totally 
amnesic. The desk girl at the l ibrary will not recall (will have 
been told not to recall) anybody asking for Dr. Kmbote on 
the day of the murder. And I am sure that Mr. Emerald will 
interrupt briefly his investigation ot some inanimate student’s 
resilient charms to deny with the vigor of roused virility that 
he ever gave anybody a bit to my house- that evening In other 
words, everything will be done to cut off my person com- 
pletely from my dear friend's fate. 

Nevertheless, I have had my little revenge: public misap- 
prehension indirectly helped me to obtain the right of pub- 
lishing Pale Fire . My good gardener, when enthusiastically re- 
lating to everybody what he had seen, certainly erred in several 
respects — not so much perhaps in his exaggerated account of 
my “heroism” as in the assumption that Shade had been de- 
liberately aimed at by the so-called Jack Grey; but Shade’s 
widow found herself so deeply affected by the idea of my 
having “thrown myseli” between the gunman and his target 
that during a scene I shall never forget, she cried out, stroking 
my hands: “There are things for which no recompense in this 
world or another is great enough.” That “other world” comes

in handy when misfortune bcfalK the infidel but I let it pass of 
course, and, indeed, resolved not to refute anything, saying 
instead: “Oh, but there is a recompense, my dear S)bil. It may 
seem to you a very modest request but — give me the permis- 
sion, Sybil, to edit and publish John's last poem.” The permis- 
sion was given at once, with new cries and new hugs, and 
already next dav her signature was under the agreement I had 
a quick little lawyer draw up. That moment of grateful grief 
you soon forgot, dear girl. But J assure you that I do not mean 
any harm, and that John Shade, perhaps, will not be too much 
annoyed by my notes, despite the intrigues and the dirt. 

Because of these machinations 1 was confronted with night- 
mare problems m m\ endeavors tv make peopje calmly see — 
without having them immediate!) scream and hustle me — the

twenty in the right-hand pocket of my coat, as many in the 
left-hand one, a batch of forty against my right nipple and the 
twelve precious ones with variants in my innermost left-breast
