### Welcome!

This is the working repository for my Distinguished Majors Program thesis for the UVa English Department. You can gain plenty more context on this project over on (the blog)[timschott.github.io] I set up. 

This repository will contain my corpus, a `SQLite` database of said corpus (in cleaned, machine readable form), various text cleaning scripts that help grow said database as well as my supervised classification work.
